  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Automated Mill represents revolutionary gradient automation technology that transforms grain processing through progressive mechanization. The construction cost of 1,800,000 ducats reflects specialized automation equipment, precision gears, and intelligent control systems. The building progresses through four automation phases: Phase 1 (25% automation, 1.3x efficiency), Phase 2 (50% automation, 1.8x efficiency), Phase 3 (75% automation, 2.4x efficiency), and Phase 4 (90% automation, 2.9x efficiency). Worker roles evolve from operators to supervisors to optimizers to innovation engineers, preserving employment while enhancing productivity. The gradient approach prevents social network fragmentation by maintaining trust relationships through skill evolution rather than displacement. This represents the future of production - mechanical precision harmonized with human insight.",
  "shortDescription": "Revolutionary mill with gradient automation technology for efficient grain-to-flour transformation.",
  "fullDescription": "The automated mill employs groundbreaking gradient automation technology that progressively reduces human dependency while maximizing production efficiency. Beginning with human operators assisted by automated systems, the mill evolves through four phases: supervised automation with quality control, hybrid optimization with strategic intervention, and finally intelligent automation with human innovation focus. Each phase maintains worker engagement while dramatically improving throughput, demonstrating that mechanical efficiency and social stability can coexist through careful systems engineering.",
