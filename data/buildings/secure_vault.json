  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Secure Vault represents specialized high-security storage with premium service fees. The construction cost of 5,000,000 ducats reflects the extraordinary security features and reinforced construction required, while the income of 50,000 ducats (1% return) represents premium fees for securing valuable items. The maintenance cost of 40,000 ducats (80% of income) creates a modest profit margin appropriate for security-focused infrastructure. The employment capacity of 8 represents the guards, administrators, and security specialists needed. The construction time of 10 days (864000000ms) reflects the specialized construction requirements. This building creates a strategic investment in financial security infrastructure with appropriate guild requirements reflecting the historical importance of secure storage in Venice's sophisticated banking and commercial system.",
