  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Textile Import House represents specialized infrastructure for high-value fabric trade. The construction cost of 4,000,000 ducats reflects the specialized storage and display facilities required, while the income of 50,000 ducats (1.25% return) represents the premium handling fees for valuable textiles. The maintenance cost of 30,000 ducats (60% of income) balances profitability with the reality of maintaining specialized climate-controlled storage. The employment capacity of 25 represents the specialized staff needed to handle, assess, and market valuable fabrics. The construction time of 9 days (777600000ms) represents a significant specialized construction project.",
