  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Apothecary balances specialized commercial investment with essential community services. The construction cost of 1,250,000 ducats reflects the specialized equipment and fixtures required, while the income of 14,000 ducats (1.1% return) represents the steady demand for medicines and treatments. The maintenance cost of 7,500 ducats (54% of income) creates a tighter profit margin than other shops, reflecting the costs of importing and maintaining exotic ingredients. The employment capacity of 3 represents the apothecary and assistants typical of Renaissance medical shops. The construction time of 3 days (259200000ms) reflects the specialized nature of the building. This building provides both direct income and community health benefits, encouraging strategic placement near residential areas.",
