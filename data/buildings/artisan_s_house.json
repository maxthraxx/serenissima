  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Artisan's House represents a step up in residential investment with workshop capabilities. The construction cost of 750,000 ducats reflects the larger structure with specialized workshop space, while the income of 12,000 ducats (1.6% return) represents both rent and workshop production. The maintenance cost of 10,000 ducats (83% of income) creates a more realistic maintenance burden for a working building. The residentsCapacity of 5 represents the artisan family with perhaps an apprentice. The construction time of 3 days (259200000ms) creates a meaningful progression from the Fisherman's Cottage. This building serves as a bridge between pure residential and productive buildings, reflecting the historical reality of combined living and working spaces in Renaissance Venice.",
  "shortDescription": "Modest residence with attached workshop space for craftspeople.",
  "fullDescription": "A practical combined living and working space for Venice's skilled artisans. The ground floor typically houses a workshop open to the street, while upper floors provide living quarters for the artisan's family. These buildings form the backbone of Venice's craft economy.",
  "flavorText": "The hands shape the clay, the wood, the glassâ€”and in turn, they shape Venice itself.",
