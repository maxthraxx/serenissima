  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Metal Import Warehouse represents critical infrastructure for industrial materials. The construction cost of 3,800,000 ducats reflects the specialized heavy-duty storage and handling facilities required, while the income of 40,000 ducats (1.05% return) represents the handling fees for essential industrial metals. The maintenance cost of 28,000 ducats (70% of income) balances profitability with the reality of maintaining specialized heavy-duty facilities. The employment capacity of 20 represents the specialized staff needed to handle, assess, and distribute industrial metals. The construction time of 10 days (864000000ms) represents a significant industrial construction project.",
  "shortDescription": "Specialized facility for importing, storing, and distributing metals for Venice's industries.",
