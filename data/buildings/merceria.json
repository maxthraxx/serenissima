  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Merceria's economic profile reflects the importance of textile retail in Venice's economy. With a construction cost of 1,000,000 ducats and income of 15,000 ducats (1.5% return), it represents a specialized investment with modest but reliable returns. The maintenance cost of 6,000 ducats (40% of income) balances profitability with realistic overhead for a specialized shop. The employment capacity of 4 reflects the staff needed to handle, display, and sell valuable textiles. The construction time of 3 days (259200000ms) represents the more refined construction and specialized fixtures required. This building creates a strategic choice for players to specialize in the lucrative textile trade, with appropriate guild requirements reflecting historical trade organization.",
  "shortDescription": "Specialized textile and fabric shop offering a variety of imported and local cloths.",
  "fullDescription": "Named after Venice's famous shopping street, these specialized shops are the center of the textile trade. Offering everything from simple local woolens to exotic silks from the East, a merceria features dramatic fabric displays, specialized measuring counters, and often a separate area for noble clients. These shops connect Venice's vital textile industry directly to consumers.",
  "flavorText": "Under these silks lie the true fabric of Veniceâ€”commerce that spans from humble wool to threads of gold.",
