  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Eastern Merchant House balances substantial investment with lucrative Eastern trade returns. The construction cost of 5,000,000 ducats reflects the specialized architecture and prestigious location required, while the income of 60,000 ducats (1.2% return) represents the high-value Eastern luxury goods trade. The maintenance cost of 30,000 ducats (50% of income) reflects the costs of maintaining cultural specialists and exotic goods handling. The employment capacity of 20 represents the staff needed to manage complex Eastern trade relationships. The construction time of 10 days (864000000ms) represents a significant project for advanced players.
