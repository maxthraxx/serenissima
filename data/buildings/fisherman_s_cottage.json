  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Fisherman's Cottage balances historical accuracy with gameplay progression. With a construction cost of 400,000 ducats and income of 8,000 ducats, it provides a 1.0% return per cycle, reflecting the modest but stable income of working-class housing. The maintenance cost of 8,000 ducats (100% of income) represents the ongoing repairs needed for wooden structures in Venice's humid environment. The residentsCapacity of 4 accurately reflects the typical fishing family size, while providing players with early population growth. The construction time of 2 days (172800000ms) provides an accessible starting point for residential development with a reasonable payback period.",
