  "calculationsAnalysis": "The Small Warehouse balances basic storage infrastructure with modest rental income. The construction cost of 1,250,000 ducats reflects the secure structure and organizational systems required, while the income of 15,000 ducats (1.2% return) represents storage rental fees. The maintenance cost of 12,500 ducats (83.3% of income) creates a thin profit margin appropriate for basic commercial infrastructure. The employment capacity of 5 represents the clerks, guards, and laborers needed. The construction time of 3 days (259200000ms) reflects the straightforward construction requirements. This building creates an accessible investment in commercial storage that supports trading activities, reflecting the historical importance of secure storage in Venice's commercial system where goods often needed to be warehoused between maritime shipments.",
  "shortDescription": "Basic goods storage facility for commercial merchandise and materials.",

Their flexible design accommodates a wide variety of goods from textiles to spices.",
  "flavorText": "The difference between a successful merchant and a ruined one often lies not in what they buy or sell, but in how they store their goods between these transactions.",
