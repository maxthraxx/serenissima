  "fullDescription": "The pinnacle of Venetian retail, these elegant spaces showcase the finest products Venice has to offer.

Often specializing in a particular luxury good—Murano glass, jewelry, imported rarities—these establishments cultivate an exclusive atmosphere that justifies premium prices.",
  "flavorText": "Here we do not simply sell objects, but rather the very essence of refinement and distinction that separates the truly cultured from the merely wealthy.",
