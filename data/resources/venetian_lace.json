    "historicalSignificance": "Venetian lace, particularly from Burano, became one of Venice's most prestigious luxury exports from the 15th century onwards. The techniques were carefully guarded, with designs treated as valuable intellectual property. The industry's development was supported by the Dogaressa Morosina Morosini in the late 16th century, who established a lace school and guild to formalize production. Venetian lace adorned both secular and religious attire throughout Europe, becoming symbols of status and refinement.",
