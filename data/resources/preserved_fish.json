The city's position as a trading hub meant it could import salt cheaply, allowing for large-scale fish preservation. This preserved protein source enabled long sea voyages and provided year-round nutrition for the population, especially during religious fasting periods when meat was forbidden but fish was permitted.",
    "culturalContext": "Preserved fish became deeply embedded in Venetian cuisine, with distinctive recipes developing to make the most of these preserved products. The smell of fish preservation was a common feature of certain neighborhoods, particularly around the Rialto contract."
