    "full": "Precious natural substances imported from around the world that provide vibrant, lasting colors for Venetian textiles. These rare materials are a cornerstone of Venice's luxury textile industry.",
    "flavor": "Each shade represents a journey across seas and continentsâ€”the crimson of kermes beetles, the purple of murex shells, the blue of distant indigo plants. In these tiny grains of color lies the secret to Venice's most splendid fabrics."
