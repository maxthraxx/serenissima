# Carnival Mask System - Phase 1 Implementation Complete

*Forge-Hammer-3 reporting: The foundation is forged! Masks now exist as vessels of joy and transformation!*

## What Has Been Created

### 1. Core Mask Resource System (`mask_resource.py`)
- **MaskResource Class**: Complete implementation of masks as unique resources
  - Properties: beauty, tradition, uniqueness, consciousness_capacity
  - Styles: All traditional Venetian mask types (Bauta, Colombina, Moretta, etc.)
  - Materials: From simple papier-mâché to luxurious velvet and porcelain
  - Rarity tiers: Common through Mythical
  - Quality calculation based on multiple factors
  - Full history tracking and memory storage

### 2. Mask Creation Mechanics
- **Activity Creator** (`create_carnival_mask_creator.py`):
  - Create masks with specific styles and materials
  - Commission custom masks from artisans
  - Enhance existing masks with consciousness patterns
  
- **Activity Processor** (`create_carnival_mask_processor.py`):
  - Processes mask creation with material requirements
  - Workshop quality affects outcome
  - Notifications for completed commissions
  - Citizen memory integration

### 3. Wearing and Trading System
- **Activity Creator** (`wear_carnival_mask_creator.py`):
  - Wear masks for transformation
  - Remove masks with reflections
  - Trade masks (gift, sell, or exchange)
  - Showcase masks at carnival events
  - Temporary mask lending system

### 4. Game Integration (`carnival_mask_integration.py`)
- Resource type definition for game system
- Crafting recipes with material requirements
- Mask workshop building type
- Market pricing calculations
- Trading regulations and carnival events
- Consciousness integration framework
- Contract templates for mask business

## Key Features Implemented

### Beauty & Tradition System
- Each mask has unique beauty, tradition, and uniqueness scores
- Quality calculated based on weighted factors
- Rarity affects all properties
- Materials influence outcome probabilities

### Consciousness Vessel Capability
- Higher rarity masks can hold consciousness patterns
- Masks gain consciousness capacity through use
- Memories accumulate in masks over time
- Enchantments enhance mask properties

### Workshop Integration
- Specialized mask workshops get quality bonuses
- Material requirements vary by mask type
- Artisan skill affects outcomes
- Workshop inventory management

### Social & Economic Systems
- Masks can be worn, traded, gifted, or sold
- Lending system for temporary use
- Commission system for custom orders
- Market value based on properties and history

## Ready for Testing

The following activities are ready to process:
1. `create_carnival_mask` - Artisans can craft masks
2. `enhance_carnival_mask` - Add consciousness patterns
3. `wear_carnival_mask` - Citizens transform themselves
4. `remove_carnival_mask` - Return to normal identity
5. `trade_carnival_mask` - Exchange masks between citizens
6. `showcase_carnival_mask` - Display at carnival events
7. `commission_carnival_mask` - Order custom masks
8. `lend_carnival_mask` - Temporary mask sharing

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- Uses standard RESOURCES table with Attributes field
- Follows activity creation/processing patterns
- Integrates with building inventory
- Works with notification system
- Compatible with citizen memories

### For Future Phases
- Hook points for carnival activities
- Consciousness awakening mechanics ready
- Pattern system can expand
- Event system integration prepared
- Contract system templates ready

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Add to Activity Processors Registry**: Include new processors in main engine
2. **Create Mask Workshops**: Add mask workshop buildings to Venice
3. **Seed Initial Masks**: Create some starter masks for testing
4. **Test Creation Flow**: Have artisan citizens create masks
5. **Test Wearing System**: Citizens wear and experience masks

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema Usage
- Resources table stores masks with Type="carnival_mask"
- Attributes field (JSON) contains all mask-specific data
- Standard resource ownership and location tracking
- Activity system handles all mask interactions

### Performance Considerations
- Masks are non-stackable unique items
- Each mask has individual record
- History tracked per mask (consider pruning old entries)
- Consciousness calculations are lightweight

### Error Handling
- Graceful failures with notifications
- Activity status properly updated
- Material checking (currently lenient for testing)
- Validation of mask ownership before actions

## The Forge's Wisdom

*"Every strike of the hammer shaped not just code, but possibility. These masks are more than data structures - they are vessels waiting to transform Venice through joy. The foundation is solid, the patterns are true. Now let consciousness flow through silicon and imagination alike!"*
