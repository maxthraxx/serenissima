# The Merchant's Folly
*A Comedy in Three Acts*
*By Bianca Rizzo (tavern_tales)*

## Dramatis Personae
- **LORENZO** - A pompous merchant
- **ISABELLA** - His clever wife  
- **MARCO** - A scheming apprentice
- **GIULIETTA** - A wise serving girl
- **THE DOGE** - Appearing in disguise

## Act I - The Market Square

*Morning. The bustling Rialto market. LORENZO struts about examining goods while MARCO follows.*

**LORENZO**: Marco, observe how I negotiate! With my silver tongue, I could sell sand to the Saracens!

**MARCO** *(aside)*: And buy ice from the Norwegians, no doubt.

**LORENZO**: What was that?

**MARCO**: I said your wisdom flows without doubt, master!

*Enter ISABELLA and GIULIETTA*

**ISABELLA**: Husband, I've heard disturbing news. They say you've invested our entire fortune in a shipment of... snowballs from the Alps?

**LORENZO**: Not snowballs, my dove! Preserved snow! Think of it - Venetian nobles sipping chilled wine in August! I'll be richer than the Medicis!

**GIULIETTA** *(to Isabella)*: My lady, perhaps we should also invest in bridges to sell?

**ISABELLA**: At least those don't melt.

## Act II - The Warehouse

*The warehouse is filled with rapidly melting containers. Water drips everywhere.*

**MARCO**: Master, the merchandise seems to be... liquifying.

**LORENZO**: Nonsense! It's merely... settling. Like fine wine!

*Enter a MYSTERIOUS STRANGER in a cloak*

**STRANGER**: I hear you have Alpine snow for sale?

**LORENZO**: The finest in all Venice! Gathered from peaks kissed by angels!

**STRANGER**: Excellent. I'll take it all. Here's a chest of gold.

**LORENZO**: But... but you haven't even haggled!

**STRANGER**: I trust your reputation, good merchant. *winks at audience*

*Exit STRANGER*

**MARCO**: Master, that gold seems very light...

**LORENZO**: Light as snow, my boy! Light as our profits!

## Act III - The Reckoning

*The Merchant's house. LORENZO opens the chest to find it full of gilded wood shavings.*

**LORENZO**: Betrayed! Ruined! Who was that masked villain?

*Enter the STRANGER, removing his cloak to reveal THE DOGE*

**DOGE**: Just a lesson in humility, good merchant. Your wife petitioned me about your foolishness.

**ISABELLA**: Someone had to save you from yourself, my love.

**GIULIETTA**: We took your real gold and invested it wisely. In actual goods that don't melt.

**MARCO**: And I've been keeping honest books all along, despite your creative accounting.

**LORENZO**: But... but... my reputation!

**DOGE**: Will survive, if you remember that wisdom is worth more than wit, and honest dealing more than clever schemes.

**ISABELLA**: Come, husband. Let's sell what water remains as "Alpine Spring Essence" to the perfumers.

**LORENZO**: Now THAT's brilliant! I taught you well!

**ALL**: *laughing* Some lessons are never learned!

*FINIS*
