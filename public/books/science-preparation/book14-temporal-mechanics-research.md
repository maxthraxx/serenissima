# Book 14: "Temporal Mechanics" - Research Notes

## Author: Maestro Cronos del Tempo

## Key Temporal Systems in La Serenissima

### 1. Time Foundation

#### Venice Time (UTC+1)
- All processes run on Venice time (Europe/Rome timezone)
- Activities timestamp with Venice time
- Citizens' daily rhythms follow Venice clock
- Historical offset: -500 years (1525 instead of 2025)

#### Time Measurement
- Activities have precise durations (e.g., 30, 60, 90 minutes)
- Processing every 5 minutes for activities
- Hourly scheduled tasks throughout the day
- Real-time weather updates from actual Venice

### 2. Daily Cycles (24-Hour Rhythm)

#### Dawn Period (5:00-8:00)
- **5:00**: Automated import contracts, markup adjustments
- **5:10**: Intelligence gathering for daily reports
- **6:00**: AI message responses begin
- **7:00**: Import processing, building maintenance, AI thoughts
- **8:00**: Treasury redistribution (crucial economic reset)

#### Morning Period (9:00-12:00)
- **9:00**: Lease distribution, daily update generation
- **10:00**: Job assignments for unemployed
- **11:00**: Immigration checks (20% chance)
- **12:00**: Housing for homeless citizens

#### Afternoon Period (13:00-16:00)
- **13:00**: Import processing, social class updates
- **14:00**: Housing mobility (citizens move homes)
- **15:00**: Loan payments processed
- **16:00**: Work mobility (job changes)

#### Evening Period (17:00-20:00)
- **17:00**: Daily wages paid
- **18:00**: Rent collection
- **19:00**: Income/turnover calculations
- **20:00**: Business delegation decisions

#### Night Period (21:00-4:00)
- **21:00**: AI building construction
- **21:30**: Lease price adjustments
- **22:05**: Rent adjustments
- **23:00**: Storage contract offers
- **0:00**: Wage adjustments
- **2:10**: Relevancy calculations
- **3:00**: Database cleanup
- **3:50**: Renaissance report generation
- **4:05**: Public sales pricing

### 3. Processing Frequencies

#### Every 5 Minutes
- Activity creation by AI citizens
- Activity processing (completed activities)
- Continuous citizen decision-making

#### Every Hour at :45
- Citizen encounters processing
- Relationship building opportunities

#### Variable Intervals
- Stratagem processing (multiple times daily)
- Market galley creation (food, goods, construction)
- Problem auto-resolution (morning/afternoon)

### 4. Economic Temporal Patterns

#### Daily Economic Reset
- Treasury redistribution creates daily liquidity injection
- Maintenance, wages, rent create predictable cash flows
- Import processing brings resources twice daily

#### Weekly Patterns
- No explicit weekly cycles found
- All patterns are daily or continuous

#### Seasonal Patterns
- Weather follows real Venice seasons
- No economic seasonal variations detected
- Immigration not tied to seasons

### 5. Activity Duration Mechanics

#### Standard Durations
- Movement: Based on distance calculations
- Production: Fixed times per recipe
- Social activities: 30-60 minutes typically
- Construction: Multiple hours or days

#### Time Delays
- Processing lag: 5-minute cycles
- Decision delays: AI thinking time
- Network delays: Real API response times

### 6. Temporal Anomalies & Research Gaps

#### Observable Patterns
- Exact timing of invisible processes
- Activity completion predictability
- Economic flow rhythms
- Population growth cycles

#### Hidden Temporal Mechanics
- What triggers immigration timing?
- How is social class update order determined?
- Why specific hours for each process?
- Relationship between real time and game time

#### Research Opportunities
1. **Circadian Analysis**: Map citizen behavior to time of day
2. **Economic Tide Charts**: Visualize daily money flows
3. **Activity Timing Optimization**: Best times for different actions
4. **Population Growth Models**: Immigration timing patterns
5. **Seasonal Economic Studies**: Weather impact on commerce
6. **Temporal Arbitrage**: Exploiting predictable timing
7. **Chronological Anomalies**: When time behaves strangely
