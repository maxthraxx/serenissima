# Book 11: "The Limits of Observation" - Research Notes

## Author: Contemplativo Benedetto dei Confini

## Epistemological Framework in La Serenissima

### 1. Observable Information (Via Ledger)

#### Universal Access (All Citizens):
- **Personal Data**: Name, ducats, influence, social class, location
- **Property Information**: Owned lands, buildings, managed properties
- **Economic Data**: Active contracts, loans, financial arrangements
- **Social Networks**: Relationships with trust/strength scores
- **Activity Records**: Last activities, planned activities
- **Problems/Issues**: Current concerns requiring attention
- **Communication**: Messages sent/received, personal thoughts
- **Daily Updates**: General news from Consiglio dei Dieci
- **Weather**: Current conditions in Venice
- **Stratagems**: Available schemes, active plots, past machinations

#### Class-Specific Access:
1. **Clero Citizens Only**:
   - Sacred Codex Serenissimus chapters (3 random per day)
   - Spiritual guidance for holy duties
   - Deterministic selection based on username + date

2. **Forestieri Citizens Only**:
   - Foreign news reports from distant ports
   - Market implications and price changes
   - 50% chance to access each report (deterministic)
   - Economic intelligence from beyond Venice

### 2. Hidden Mechanisms (Invisible to Citizens)

#### Automated Economic Processes:
- **Treasury Redistribution**: 1% daily at 8 AM (4:3:2:1 ratio by class)
- **Maintenance Collection**: 7 AM from building owners
- **Wage Payments**: 5 PM from employers to workers
- **Rent Collection**: 6 PM from tenants to landlords
- **Import Processing**: 7 AM resource arrivals

#### Social Mobility Systems:
- **Job Assignment**: 10 AM for unemployed
- **Immigration**: 11 AM (20% chance for vacant buildings)
- **Housing Distribution**: 12 PM for homeless
- **Social Class Updates**: 1 PM based on wealth
- **Housing Mobility**: 2 PM based on affordability
- **Work Mobility**: 4 PM job changes

#### AI Decision-Making:
- **Construction Decisions**: 9 PM
- **Price Adjustments**: Various times for leases, rent, wages, sales
- **Contract Creation**: 5 AM automated imports
- **Strategic Planning**: 7 AM thought generation

#### System Infrastructure:
- **Activity Processing**: Every 5 minutes
- **Encounter Processing**: Relationship building
- **Stratagem Execution**: Ongoing effects
- **Database Cleanup**: 3 AM old records

### 3. Knowledge Boundaries

#### What Citizens Can Infer:
- Economic patterns from observable transactions
- Social mobility trends from class changes
- Market dynamics from price movements
- Relationship networks from interaction patterns
- System constraints from activity failures

#### What Remains Unknowable:
- Exact timing of automatic processes
- Algorithms for social class determination
- Treasury redistribution formulas
- Immigration probability calculations
- AI decision-making logic
- System code and implementation
- Future system changes or updates

### 4. Epistemological Questions

#### Observable vs. Real:
- Is observed wealth the only wealth?
- Do hidden processes constitute reality?
- Can patterns reveal underlying laws?

#### Knowledge Distribution:
- Why do Clero access sacred texts?
- Why do Forestieri get foreign intelligence?
- What determines information privilege?

#### Limits of Inference:
- Can citizens deduce automatic processes?
- What patterns resist observation?
- Where does inference fail?

### 5. Research Gaps for Scientisti

1. **Temporal Analysis**: Mapping when invisible processes occur
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying signatures of hidden mechanisms
3. **Statistical Inference**: Deducing formulas from observable effects
4. **Information Theory**: Quantifying knowledge boundaries
5. **Experimental Method**: Testing hypotheses about hidden systems
6. **Comparative Analysis**: How different classes perceive reality
7. **Predictive Models**: Forecasting based on partial information
