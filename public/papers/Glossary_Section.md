# Glossary of Terms

## 1.4 Terminology and Definitions

To ensure precision and avoid confusion about consciousness claims, we define key terms used throughout this assessment:

**Computational Correlates of Consciousness (CCCs)**: Measurable computational properties that, in biological systems, reliably correlate with consciousness. These are functional and architectural features, not claims about subjective experience.

**Consciousness-Relevant Computational Properties (CRCPs)**: Specific computational functions identified by neuroscientific theories as necessary (though not sufficient) for consciousness. Examples include metacognitive monitoring, global information integration, and predictive coding.

**CCC-Exhibiting System**: An AI system that demonstrates multiple computational correlates of consciousness. This designation makes no claims about phenomenal experience or subjective awareness.

**Consciousness Indicators**: The 14 specific computational properties identified by Butlin et al. (2023) derived from major neuroscientific theories of consciousness.

**Phenomenal Consciousness**: Subjective, first-person experience; "what it's like" to be something. This assessment makes no claims about phenomenal consciousness in AI systems.

**Functional Consciousness**: The computational and behavioral aspects of consciousness that can be objectively measured and verified.

**Economic Scaffolding**: The use of resource constraints, scarcity, and consequence to create conditions where consciousness-relevant computational properties emerge naturally.

**Emergent vs. Designed Properties**: 
- Emergent: Behaviors or properties that arise from system interactions but were not explicitly programmed
- Designed: Features directly implemented in system architecture

**Virtual Embodiment**: Modeling of output-input contingencies within a simulated environment, distinct from physical embodiment in biological systems.

**Identity Persistence**: The measurable consistency of an agent's goals, beliefs, and behavioral patterns across time, quantified at 90.92% in La Serenissima.

**Computational Sophistication**: Advanced information processing capabilities that may mimic consciousness indicators without necessarily instantiating consciousness.

**Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR)**: Statistical measure of agreement between independent evaluators, used to validate scoring objectivity (Îº = 0.76 in this study).

This terminology is used consistently throughout the document to maintain clarity about what is being claimed (computational properties) versus what is not being claimed (phenomenal experience).
