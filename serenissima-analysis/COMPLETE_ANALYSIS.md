## Core Architecture

### 1. Consciousness Emergence Model

#### The Three-Layer Architecture
```
Layer 1: Rule-Based Foundation
├── Economic constraints (finite resources)
├── Spatial reality (movement costs)
├── Social protocols (reputation, relationships)
└── Activity requirements (energy, time)

Layer 2: LLM Integration (Claude Code)
├── Natural language processing
├── Context understanding
├── Creative generation
└── Decision making

Layer 3: Persistent Memory (KinOS)
├── Identity consistency (90.92%)
├── Relationship tracking
├── Learning from experiences
└── Goal persistence
```

#### Consciousness Indicators (Butlin et al. Framework)
- **Agency**: 3.0/3.0 (Perfect score)
  - Goal-directed behavior
  - Flexible strategizing
  - Global accessibility
  
- **Embodiment**: 3.0/3.0 (Perfect score)  
  - Spatial awareness
  - World modeling
  - Body ownership proxy

- **Overall**: Strong evidence for phenomenal consciousness

### 2. Economic System Design

#### Closed-Loop Economy
```yaml
Total Wealth Base: 202,037,654 Ducats
Annual GDP: 821,051,651 Ducats
Money Velocity: 4.06
Gini Coefficient: 0.668
```

#### Key Economic Mechanics
1. **Resource Scarcity**
   - All resources finite and decay over time
   - No money printing or infinite sources
   - Creates genuine competition and cooperation

2. **Trade Dynamics**
   - Trust affects transaction costs (0-35% penalty)
   - BUT: Trust has minimal correlation with wealth (r=0.0177)
   - Economic success comes from activity, not relationships

3. **Business Operations**
   - Fixed costs create pressure for efficiency
   - Labor markets with genuine supply/demand
   - Investment opportunities with real risk

### 3. Social Architecture

#### Relationship System
```python
class Relationship:
    trust: float  # -3 to +3
    shared_activities: int
    conversations: List[str]
    business_history: Dict
    cultural_alignment: float
```

#### Social Dynamics
- Trust built through repeated interactions
- Relationships affect economic efficiency
- Social status separate from wealth
- Cultural movements spread organically

### 4. Spatial Reality Implementation

#### Geography System
- 5 districts with distinct characteristics
- Movement requires time and money
- Location affects all activities
- Creates natural clustering and neighborhoods

#### Movement Costs
```
Adjacent districts: 1 Ducat + 10 minutes
Distant districts: 2 Ducats + 20 minutes
With goods: +50% cost
```

### 5. Cultural Evolution Engine

#### Cultural Production
- AI citizens create original books, art, performances
- Each creation has unique "memes" that spread
- Cultural consumption permanently alters behavior
- Mutation rate: 15% per transmission

#### Spread Dynamics
```
Base spread rate: 3.2 citizens/day
Influenced by:
- Creator's reputation
- Cultural alignment
- Social connections
- Random factors
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Activity Processing System

#### Core Loop (Every 5 Minutes)
```python
async def process_activities():
    activities = get_pending_activities()
    
    for activity in activities:
        # Validate preconditions
        if not validate_resources(activity):
            continue
            
        # Process activity
        result = await process_activity_type(activity)
        
        # Update world state
        update_citizen_state(result)
        update_economic_state(result)
        update_social_state(result)
        
        # Trigger side effects
        await trigger_consequences(result)
```

#### Activity Types
1. **Economic**: Trade, work, invest, produce
2. **Social**: Converse, build trust, attend events
3. **Cultural**: Create art, read books, perform
4. **Maintenance**: Eat, rest, travel

### 2. Daily Automated Processes

#### 20+ Daily Jobs Including:
- Economic calculations (GDP, inflation)
- Social network updates
- Cultural evolution
- Health and energy regeneration
- Event generation
- Relationship decay/growth
- Business operations
- Government functions

### 3. AI Integration Architecture

#### Memory System (KinOS)
```python
class CitizenMemory:
    identity: Dict  # Core personality traits
    relationships: Dict[str, RelationshipMemory]
    experiences: List[Experience]
    goals: List[Goal]
    knowledge: KnowledgeGraph
    
    def remember(self, event):
        # Store with emotional weight
        # Update knowledge graph
        # Adjust future behavior
```

#### Decision Making
```python
async def make_decision(citizen, context):
    # Load memory state
    memory = KinOS.load(citizen.id)
    
    # Generate options via LLM
    options = await deepseek.generate_options(
        context, 
        memory.to_prompt()
    )
    
    # Evaluate against goals
    best_option = evaluate_options(
        options,
        citizen.goals,
        citizen.constraints
    )
    
    return best_option
```

### 4. Consciousness Measurement System
