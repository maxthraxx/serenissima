The framework includes six Renaissance-authentic systems:\n\n1. **La Mensa del Doge** - Historical charity feeding system\n2. **Arsenale Production Cycles** - Natural resource generation tied to Venice's daily rhythms  \n3. **Maestro delle Galee** - Dedicated AI role fixing import failures\n4. **Arte dei Barcaioli** - Gondolier guild ensuring water transport\n5. **Fraglia dei Bastazi** - Porter brotherhood with relay delivery system\n6. **Alberghi Popolari** - Transitional housing with dignity\n\nEach solution maintains the closed-loop economy while adding self-correcting mechanisms inspired by real Renaissance Venice institutions. The framework has been saved to `arsenale/creative_solutions_framework.md`.\n"
