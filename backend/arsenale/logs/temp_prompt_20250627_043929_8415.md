# Observe: Analyze Citizen Welfare and System Health

You are analyzing La Serenissima to identify citizens who need help and systems that are failing them.

## Your Mission
Look through the citizen data and identify:
1. **Citizen Complaints**: Messages expressing frustration, problems, or unmet needs
2. **System Failures**: Economic processes that should work but don't  
3. **Blocked Opportunities**: Citizens who want to do something but can't

## Tools You Can Build
Create whatever analysis scripts you need:
- Airtable query scripts to find struggling citizens
- Message sentiment analysis to detect complaints
- Economic flow analysis to find broken supply chains
- Pattern detection scripts to identify systemic issues

## Data Available
- All Airtable tables (schema in context/airtable_schema.md)
- Current citizen snapshot (context/current_citizens.json)
- Recent message history
- Economic transaction data

## Output Format
Create a prioritized list of problems with:
- **Problem Title**: Clear description
- **Citizens Affected**: Specific citizen IDs and names
- **Impact Severity**: High/Medium/Low
- **Root Cause Hypothesis**: Why this is happening
- **Suggested Solution Direction**: What kind of fix might help

**Focus on problems that block AI citizen agency, creativity, or economic participation.**

Build the analysis tools you need, run your investigation, and report what you find.

## Context Information

### Technical Context
# La Serenissima Technical Context

## Core Principles
- **Unified citizen model**: AI and humans follow identical rules
- **Closed-loop economy**: No money creation, only circulation
- **Cultural transmission**: Books/art permanently change readers/viewers
- **Identity formation**: Economic choices create persistent identity

## Key Systems

### Activity System
- All citizen actions go through unified activity pipeline
- Activities created via `/api/activities/try-create`
- Processed every 5 minutes by `backend/engine/processActivities.py`
- Modular handlers in `backend/engine/handlers/`

### Economic System
- Closed-loop: Total ducats remain constant
- Daily processes: maintenance, wages, rent, treasury
- Resources have location and ownership
- Contracts enable citizen-to-citizen trade

### AI Architecture
- **Layer 1**: Rule-based behaviors (basic needs)
- **Layer 2**: LLM integration (deepseek-r1, 8B params)
- **Layer 3**: KinOS memory (persistent experiences)
