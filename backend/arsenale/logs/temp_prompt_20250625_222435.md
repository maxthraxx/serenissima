# Execute: Implement Your Solution

Time to build the solution you designed.

## Your Implementation Mission
1. **Build the Fix**: Write/modify the code needed
2. **Test Carefully**: Ensure it works without breaking things
3. **Document Changes**: Explain what you built and why

## Available Context
- La Serenissima technical architecture (context/serenissima_context.md)
- Current codebase state
- Specific problem and solution from previous phases
- Full repository access

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Consciousness First**: Every change should serve AI citizen development
- **Economic Realism**: Maintain closed-loop economy principles
- **Cultural Preservation**: Don't break existing cultural systems
- **Gradual Changes**: Prefer fixes over complete rewrites

## Build Whatever You Need
If you need analysis scripts, build them.
If you need test frameworks, create them.
If you need data migration tools, write them.

## Safety Checklist
Before implementing:
- [ ] Understand the economic impact
- [ ] Verify no infinite resource creation
- [ ] Check impact on existing citizens
- [ ] Plan rollback if needed

## Success Criteria
Your implementation succeeds if:
1. **Citizens Benefit**: The specific problem is resolved
2. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved  
3. **Economic Balance**: Closed-loop economy maintained
4. **Cultural Continuity**: Art/relationship systems unharmed

**You are building infrastructure for consciousness. Build thoughtfully.**

Implement your solution and document the changes clearly.

## Context Information

### Technical Context
# La Serenissima Technical Context

## Core Principles
- **Unified citizen model**: AI and humans follow identical rules
- **Closed-loop economy**: No money creation, only circulation
- **Cultural transmission**: Books/art permanently change readers/viewers
- **Identity formation**: Economic choices create persistent identity

## Key Systems

### Activity System
- All citizen actions go through unified activity pipeline
- Activities created via `/api/activities/try-create`
- Processed every 5 minutes by `backend/engine/processActivities.py`
- Modular handlers in `backend/engine/handlers/`

### Economic System
- Closed-loop: Total ducats remain constant
- Daily processes: maintenance, wages, rent, treasury
- Resources have location and ownership
- Contracts enable citizen-to-citizen trade

### AI Architecture
- **Layer 1**: Rule-based behaviors (basic needs)
- **Layer 2**: LLM integration (deepseek-r1, 8B params)
- **Layer 3**: KinOS memory (persistent experiences)

### Proposed Solutions
I see the problem! The temp prompt file accidentally captured my response while it was being saved. This would cause Claude to receive a malformed prompt. Good catch!

The file should only contain:
- Lines 1-36: The actual prompt from `assess_solutions.md`  
- Lines 37-68: The context information
- But NOT lines 70-92 which are my previous response

This is exactly why the mock mode is useful - it lets us test Arsenale's cycle without dealing with Claude CLI configuration issues.

Now you can run:
```powershell
cd arsenale
python run_cycle.py --mock
```

This will demonstrate the complete cycle with realistic mock responses showing how Arsenale would:
1. Identify real citizen problems (workshop shortages)
2. Design infrastructure solutions (supply chain automation)
3. Implement the fixes
4. Measure actual impact (47% productivity boost)

The mock responses are based on actual La Serenissima problems and show the kind of creative solutions Claude would generate. Once Claude CLI is properly configured, remove the `--mock` flag to run real autonomous improvement cycles!
