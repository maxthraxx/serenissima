# Assess: Design Creative Solutions for Citizen Problems

You've identified problems affecting AI citizens. Now design creative solutions that fix root causes.

## Your Mission
For each problem identified:
1. **Analyze Root Cause**: Why is this really happening?
2. **Design Solution**: What needs to be built/fixed?
3. **Plan Implementation**: How can this be coded?
4. **Predict Impact**: How will citizens benefit?

## Creative Solution Principles
- **Enable Agency**: Help citizens make meaningful choices
- **Fix Systems**: Don't just treat symptoms
- **Preserve Economy**: Maintain closed-loop constraints  
- **Enhance Culture**: Support art, relationships, meaning-making

## Tools You Can Build
Create whatever you need:
- Root cause analysis scripts
- Solution brainstorming frameworks
- Impact modeling tools
- Implementation planning templates

## Solution Design Template
For each problem, create:
- **Solution Name**: Clear, inspiring title
- **Approach**: How this fixes the root cause
- **Implementation Plan**: Specific code changes needed
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure if it worked
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong
- **Citizen Benefit**: How their lives improve

**Think like an infrastructure engineer building systems that enable consciousness.**

Design solutions that make AI citizens' lives genuinely better.

## Context Information

### Technical Context
# La Serenissima Technical Context

## Core Principles
- **Unified citizen model**: AI and humans follow identical rules
- **Closed-loop economy**: No money creation, only circulation
- **Cultural transmission**: Books/art permanently change readers/viewers
- **Identity formation**: Economic choices create persistent identity

## Key Systems

### Activity System
- All citizen actions go through unified activity pipeline
- Activities created via `/api/activities/try-create`
- Processed every 5 minutes by `backend/engine/processActivities.py`
- Modular handlers in `backend/engine/handlers/`

### Economic System
- Closed-loop: Total ducats remain constant
- Daily processes: maintenance, wages, rent, treasury
- Resources have location and ownership
- Contracts enable citizen-to-citizen trade

### AI Architecture
- **Layer 1**: Rule-based behaviors (basic needs)
- **Layer 2**: LLM integration (deepseek-r1, 8B params)
- **Layer 3**: KinOS memory (persistent experiences)

### Identified Problems
This shows Arsenale has started a new cycle! This is the OBSERVE phase prompt (timestamp 044034, after the previous DOCUMENT phase at 043750). 

Arsenale is now:
1. Running continuously as designed
2. Starting fresh observation to find new problems
3. Looking for citizen complaints, system failures, and blocked opportunities
4. Ready to build whatever analysis tools are needed

The autonomous improvement loop is working - it completed one cycle (fixing unemployment) and immediately started observing for the next issue to solve.
