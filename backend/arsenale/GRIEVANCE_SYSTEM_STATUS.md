# Grievance System Status Report

## Current State (July 5, 2025)

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Airtable Tables Exist**
   - GRIEVANCES table: ✅ (2 records)
   - GRIEVANCE_SUPPORT table: ✅ (0 records)

2. **Backend Code Implemented**
   - Activity creators (file_grievance, support_grievance): ✅
   - Activity processors: ✅
   - Governance handlers: ✅
   - API endpoints in main.py: ✅
   - Scheduled review process: ✅

3. **Local Fixes Applied**
   - Added grievances tables to processActivities.py
   - Added grievances tables to createActivities.py
   - Fixed table key references (uppercase → lowercase)

### ❌ What's Not Working
1. **API Endpoints Return 404**
   - `/api/governance/grievances`
   - `/api/governance/stats`
   - `/api/governance/proposals`
   - **Reason**: Production backend doesn't have the latest code deployed

2. **AI Citizens Not Filing Grievances**
   - The governance handler exists but AI citizens may not be using it
   - Need to verify leisure time activities include governance participation

## How the System Works

### Filing Process
1. During leisure time, AI citizens can create `file_grievance` activities
2. They go to the Doge's Palace and pay 50 ducats filing fee
3. The grievance is recorded with category, title, and description
4. Citizens gain 50 influence points for civic participation

### Support Process
1. Citizens can create `support_grievance` activities for existing grievances
2. They pay 10 ducats to show support
3. Support count increases for the grievance
4. Citizens gain 20 influence points

### Review Process
1. Daily at 20:15 Venice time, `review_grievances.py` runs
2. Grievances with 20+ supporters are marked "under_review"
3. Notifications are sent to relevant officials
4. Future phases will convert popular grievances to proposals

## Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Deploy Backend Code
The production backend needs to be updated with the latest code that includes:
- Grievance API endpoints
- Updated table initializations
- Activity processors for grievances

### 2. Verify AI Participation
Check if AI citizens are:
- Creating grievance activities during leisure time
- Having their grievances properly processed
- The governance handler is being called

### 3. Test Full Workflow
Once deployed:
- Test API endpoints
- Monitor AI citizens filing grievances
- Verify support activities work
- Check scheduled review process

## Code Changes Made

### processActivities.py (line 262-263)
```python
'grievances': api.table(base_id, 'GRIEVANCES'),
'grievance_support': api.table(base_id, 'GRIEVANCE_SUPPORT')
```

### createActivities.py (line 152-153)
```python
'grievances': api.table(base_id, 'GRIEVANCES'),
'grievance_support': api.table(base_id, 'GRIEVANCE_SUPPORT')
```

### file_grievance_processor.py (line 81)
```python
grievances_table = tables.get('grievances')  # Changed from 'GRIEVANCES'
```

### support_grievance_processor.py (lines 85-86)
```python
support_table = tables.get('grievance_support')  # Changed from 'GRIEVANCE_SUPPORT'
grievances_table = tables.get('grievances')  # Changed from 'GRIEVANCES'
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Proposal System
- Convert popular grievances to formal proposals
- Allow voting on proposals
- Track implementation status

### Phase 3: Full Democracy
- Elections for positions
- Citizen-proposed laws
- Budget allocation voting

## Conclusion

The grievance system is **fully implemented in code** but needs **deployment to production** to become active. Once deployed, Venice's citizens will have their first taste of democratic participation through formal complaints that can gain community support and official review.
