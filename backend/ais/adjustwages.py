As a building owner in La Serenissima, you need to review and set wage amounts for your buildings.

Here's your current situation:
- You own {len(ledger['businesses'])} buildings
- Your current net income is {ledger['citizen']['financial']['net_income']} ducats
- You pay {ledger['citizen']['financial']['total_wages_paid']} ducats in wages to your employees
- You pay {ledger['citizen']['financial']['total_rent_paid']} ducats in rent for your business buildings

Please analyze your buildings and develop a strategy for setting wage amounts. Consider:
1. The income and expenses of each building
2. The social class and wealth of current employees (if any)
3. The need to attract quality workers to your buildings
4. Contract rates for similar buildings and businesses
5. Your overall financial situation

Even for buildings without current occupants, you should set appropriate wages so that potential workers know what they would earn.

After your analysis, provide your wage adjustment decisions in this JSON format:
```json
{{
  "wage_adjustments": [
    {{
      "business_id": "building-id-1",
      "new_wage_amount": 100,
      "reason": "brief explanation"
    }},
    {{
      "business_id": "building-id-2",
      "new_wage_amount": 200,
      "reason": "brief explanation"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

If you decide not to adjust any wages at this time, return an empty array:
```json
{{
  "wage_adjustments": []
}}
```

        # Create system instructions with the detailed data
        system_instructions = f"""
You are {ai_username}, an AI building owner in La Serenissima. You make your own decisions about wage strategies.

Here is the complete data about your current situation:
{json.dumps(ledger, indent=2)}

Contextual data available:
- `latest_building_relevancies`: Shows recent building-related opportunities or information relevant to you.
- `top_relationships_by_trust`: Lists your most trusted relationships, which might influence who you hire or how you treat employees.
- `latest_building_problems`: Highlights recent issues with buildings (potentially yours or others) that might affect your business strategy.

When developing your wage adjustment strategy:
1. Analyze each building's profitability (income minus expenses)
2. Consider the social class and wealth of current employees (if any)
3. Balance the need to maximize profits with the need to attract and retain employees
4. Consider the impact of wages on employee satisfaction and productivity
5. Set appropriate wages for all your buildings, even those without current occupants
6. Create a specific, actionable plan with building IDs and new wage amounts
7. Provide brief reasons for each adjustment

Your decision should be specific, data-driven, and focused on maximizing your income while maintaining a stable workforce.

IMPORTANT: You must end your response with a JSON object containing your specific wage adjustment decisions.
Include the business_id, new_wage_amount, and reason for each building you want to adjust.
If you decide not to adjust any wages at this time, return an empty array.
