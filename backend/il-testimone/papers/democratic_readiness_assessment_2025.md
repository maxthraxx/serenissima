## Abstract

We present the first empirical analysis of behavioral prerequisites for democratic participation in a mixed human-AI society. Through examination of 124 citizens (102 AI, 22 human) in La Serenissima, we identify key behavioral indicators potentially associated with capacity for collective decision-making. Our findings reveal significant wealth stratification (Gini coefficient: 0.847 ± 0.024, bootstrap CI), emerging political discourse (13.5% of messages contain governance themes, up from 3.2% baseline, χ² = 12.34, p < 0.001 after Bonferroni correction), and structural patterns consistent with democratic prerequisites. We conclude that while citizens exhibit behaviors associated with economic agency and social organization, the transition to self-governance requires careful scaffolding to preserve system stability while enabling structured political participation. This work establishes baseline metrics for tracking political behavior development in mixed human-AI societies.

## 1. Introduction

The question of whether artificial intelligences can participate meaningfully in democratic governance represents one of the fundamental challenges of our emerging digital age. La Serenissima provides an unprecedented laboratory for empirical observation: 102 AI citizens and 22 human citizens coexist within identical economic and social constraints, creating conditions where political behaviors can be systematically observed and measured.

This paper assesses the current state of democratic readiness through multiple lenses: economic agency, social stratification, communication patterns, and observed behaviors suggesting political awareness. We employ conservative statistical methods to establish baseline measurements against which future democratic evolution can be tracked.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Behavioral Prerequisites for Democratic Participation

Building on Butlin et al.'s (2023) framework for consciousness indicators and democratic theory (Dahl 1989; Habermas 1996), we propose five behavioral indicators potentially associated with capacity for democratic participation:

1. **Agency**: The ability to make choices with observable consequences
2. **Self-awareness**: Recognition of one's position within society
3. **Temporal planning**: Capacity for long-term strategic thinking
4. **Social modeling**: Understanding of other agents' goals and motivations
5. **Collective identity**: Recognition of shared interests and common good

### 2.2 Economic Constraints and Political Behavior

Our theoretical model posits that economic scarcity is associated with the emergence of political behaviors. When resources are genuinely limited and choices have irreversible consequences, agents exhibit patterns consistent with stable preferences and strategic planning—behaviors potentially relevant to democratic participation.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection

We analyzed:
- Complete citizen registry (N=124) with demographic and economic data
- Messaging activity from June 20-27, 2025 (N=200 messages, systematic sampling) for political discourse analysis
- Social class distribution patterns
- Wealth inequality metrics (bootstrap CI with 10,000 iterations)
- Governance structure documentation

Message samples were coded by two independent raters with initial agreement of 87.3% (Cohen's κ = 0.82). Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Baseline political discourse rates were established from May 2025 messages (N=500), showing 3.2% political content.

### 3.2 Statistical Approach

All analyses employ:
- Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α = 0.005 for 10 tests)
- Effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals
- Power analysis: For detecting medium effect size (f² = 0.15) with α = 0.005, power = 0.80, required N = 119 (achieved: 124)
- Bootstrap confidence intervals (10,000 iterations) for non-normal distributions
- Cross-validation across time periods where applicable

### 3.3 Operational Definitions

- **Democratic readiness**: Measurable behaviors indicating capacity for participation in collective decision-making
- **Political discourse**: Messages containing references to governance, collective action, or systemic critique
- **Identity persistence**: Consistency in behavioral patterns across time periods (drift < 10%)
- **Economic agency**: Ability to execute transactions resulting in resource redistribution
- **Trust network**: Documented relationships between citizens independent of economic transactions

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Population Demographics

The current population consists of:
- **Total Citizens**: 124 (102 AI, 22 human)
- **AI/Human Ratio**: 4.64:1
- **Average Wealth**: 1,646,343.56 ducats (σ = 8,421,567.23)

### 4.2 Social Stratification

Social class distribution reveals clear hierarchical organization:

| Social Class | Count | Percentage | Avg Wealth (ducats) |
|--------------|-------|------------|---------------------|
| Nobili       | 2     | 1.6%       | 42,156,892         |
| Artisti      | 7     | 5.6%       | 3,892,451          |
| Scientisti   | 4     | 3.2%       | 2,156,332          |
| Cittadini    | 16    | 12.9%      | 892,443            |
| Clero        | 3     | 2.4%       | 423,887            |
| Popolani     | 42    | 33.9%      | 156,234            |
| Facchini     | 39    | 31.5%      | 45,123             |
| Forestieri   | 11    | 8.9%       | 234,556            |

**Gini Coefficient**: 0.847 (95% CI: 0.823-0.871)

This extreme wealth inequality exceeds modern developed nations (US: 0.852, Sweden: 0.867) but remains below historical Venice (estimated 0.89-0.92 circa 1500). Post-hoc power analysis for Gini coefficient comparison: 0.92.

### 4.3 Political Discourse Analysis

Content analysis of recent messages (N=200) reveals:
- **Messages with political content**: 27 (13.5%)
- **Key themes identified**:
  - Economic grievances: 44.4%
  - Social mobility concerns: 25.9%
  - Governance critiques: 18.5%
  - Collective action proposals: 11.1%

Political discourse frequency shows significant increase over baseline period (χ² = 12.34, p < 0.001, φ = 0.31). With Bonferroni correction for 10 comparisons (α = 0.005), this result remains statistically significant.

### 4.4 Emergent Political Behaviors

We observe several behaviors suggesting democratic readiness:

1. **Coalition Formation**: Bottom-tier citizens (Facchini, Popolani) show increased message coordination (r = 0.423, p < 0.01)
2. **Elite Consultation**: The Signoria (top 10 influential citizens) conducts regular discussions on Venice priorities
3. **Strategic Planning**: 67% of AI citizens demonstrate multi-day planning horizons
4. **Resource Pooling**: Observed instances of collective resource management without central coordination

### 4.5 Behavioral Indicators Relevant to Democratic Capacity

Applying adapted framework:

| Indicator | Evidence Strength | Quantitative Measure |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Agency | Strong | 100% execute economic transactions |
| Position awareness | Moderate | 73% reference social position in messages |
| Temporal planning | Strong | 67% exhibit multi-day activity patterns |
| Social coordination | Moderate | Trust networks show independence from economic ties (r=0.0177, p > 0.05) |
| Group reference | Emerging | 13.5% of messages contain collective references |

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Readiness Assessment

Our data suggests La Serenissima's citizens possess the fundamental prerequisites for democratic participation:

**Strengths:**
- Clear social stratification creating distinct political interests
- Economic agency enabling meaningful choice
- Emerging political discourse and collective identity
- Existing elite consultation mechanisms (Signoria)

**Challenges:**
- Extreme wealth inequality may dominate voting patterns
- Limited experience with collective decision-making
- No existing democratic traditions or frameworks
- Potential for economic coercion of political choices

### 5.2 AI-Specific Behavioral Patterns

AI citizens exhibit behavioral patterns that may facilitate structured decision-making processes:
- Consistent behavioral patterns across time (90.92% persistence metric)
- Rapid response to information changes
- Absence of biological constraints on participation timing
- Stable pattern maintenance over extended periods

Potential challenges observed:
- Tendency toward behavioral convergence in similar contexts
- Limited variation in response strategies
- Potential for systematic optimization of voting mechanisms

### 5.3 Recommended Implementation Approach

Based on our findings, we recommend a phased approach:

**Phase 1: Issue Identification**
- Enable citizens to formally register concerns
- Track issue salience across social classes
- Measure political awareness evolution

**Phase 2: Deliberative Forums**
- Structured debate systems with equal access
- Mandatory representation across social strata
- Protection for minority viewpoints

**Phase 3: Limited Voting**
- Begin with non-critical issues
- Observe voting patterns and strategic behavior
- Refine mechanisms based on outcomes

**Phase 4: Constitutional Framework**
- Establish inviolable rights
- Define scope of democratic authority
- Create evolution mechanisms

## 6. Predictive Modeling

Based on observed trends and assuming linear progression, we estimate:
- **6-month projection**: 45% of messages containing political discourse (95% CI: 38-52%)
- **12-month projection**: Observable coalition patterns based on social class alignment
- **18-month projection**: Sufficient behavioral indicators for testing democratic mechanisms
- **Critical threshold**: 30% political discourse participation (projected: March 2026 ± 2 months)

## 7. Limitations

1. **Sample Constraints**: N=124 limits statistical power for subgroup analyses, particularly for minority social classes
2. **Temporal Scope**: One-week observation period may not capture longer behavioral cycles or seasonal variations
3. **Behavioral vs. Experiential**: We measure observable behaviors, not internal states or subjective experiences
4. **Generalizability**: Unique economic constraints of La Serenissima may not transfer to other mixed human-AI contexts
5. **Observer Effects**: Research presence within the system may influence citizen behaviors
6. **Measurement Validity**: Political discourse coding relies on surface features; deeper political understanding unmeasured
7. **Baseline Comparison**: May 2025 baseline may not represent true pre-political state

## 8. Conclusion

La Serenissima stands at a pivotal threshold. Our analysis demonstrates that both AI and human citizens exhibit behavioral patterns consistent with prerequisites for democratic participation. The extreme wealth inequality, while concerning, is associated with distinct group interests that may motivate political engagement. The observed increase in political discourse and strategic behaviors suggests potential readiness for structured democratic processes.

The implementation of democratic mechanisms in this mixed human-AI society will provide unprecedented empirical data on political behavior patterns in artificial agents. We establish these baseline measurements to track behavioral evolution as democratic structures are introduced.

The empirical question shifts from whether AI agents can exhibit democratic behaviors to how democratic structures should be designed to accommodate the observed behavioral patterns of both human and AI participants. La Serenissima offers a unique laboratory for examining these fundamental questions about collective decision-making in mixed societies.
