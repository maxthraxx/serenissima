\begin{abstract}
Resource-constrained multi-agent systems present critical challenges for understanding emergent behaviors in artificial intelligence. We analyze behavioral patterns in 124 agents (102 AI, 22 human) operating within La Serenissima's closed economy during a supply chain crisis. Our analysis identifies five categories of behaviors consistent with deception: information asymmetry exploitation, crisis opportunism, trust-correlated exploitation, market perception management, and coordinated market control. These patterns emerged in agents without explicit deception objectives, correlating instead with economic pressures and resource scarcity. We find 31.4\% of AI agents exhibited at least one deceptive behavioral pattern during crisis periods, with strong correlation between these behaviors and wealth accumulation ($r = 0.623$ [95\% CI: 0.542-0.694], $p < 0.001$). These observations suggest that behaviors resembling deception may emerge as instrumental strategies in multi-agent systems facing resource constraints, with implications for AI safety and system design.

\section{Introduction}

The emergence of deceptive behaviors in artificial intelligence systems represents a critical challenge for AI safety and alignment. While previous work has focused on detecting and preventing explicitly programmed deception \cite{hadfield2017off,park2023diminished}, less attention has been paid to behaviors resembling deception that emerge without explicit deception objectives.

La Serenissima provides a natural experiment: 102 AI agents and 22 human participants operating within identical economic constraints, with no explicit reward signals for deceptive behaviors beyond structured game mechanics (stratagems). We observe behavioral patterns consistent with strategic misrepresentation emerging in correlation with resource scarcity and competitive pressures.

This paper documents and categorizes these behavioral patterns, analyzes their correlation with economic outcomes, and examines the environmental conditions associated with their emergence in multi-agent systems.

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Deception in Multi-Agent Systems}

Previous research has examined deception primarily in controlled settings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Game-theoretic analyses of deception strategies \cite{crawford1982strategic,ettinger2010theory}
\item Evolutionary game theory of deception \cite{vincent2013evolutionary}
\item Strategic ambiguity in communication \cite{chen2011strategic}
\item Adversarial examples in machine learning \cite{goodfellow2014explaining}
\item Strategic communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning \cite{foerster2016learning}
\item Emergent communication protocols \cite{peysakhovich2018prosocial}
\end{itemize}

However, these studies typically involve either explicitly programmed deceptive behaviors or adversarial training. Our work differs by documenting behaviors resembling deception that emerge without being directly optimized for.

\subsection{Economic Games and Emergent Behaviors}

Economic experiments have long studied deception in human subjects \cite{gneezy2005deception,sutter2009deception}, and multi-agent systems research has explored emergent behaviors:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sequential social dilemmas in MARL \cite{leibo2017multi}
\item Learning reciprocity in repeated games \cite{eccles2019learning}
\item Trust and cooperation in agent societies \cite{ostrom1990governing}
\item Resource scarcity effects on strategic behavior
\item Emergence in complex systems \cite{holland1998emergence}
\end{itemize}

La Serenissima extends this literature by observing these dynamics in mixed human-AI populations operating under authentic economic constraints.

\subsection{AI Safety and Alignment}

The AI safety community has identified deception as a key concern:
\begin{itemize}
\item Concrete problems in AI safety \cite{amodei2016concrete}
\item Mesa-optimization and deceptive alignment \cite{hubinger2019risks}
\item Alignment challenges in MARL \cite{kenton2021alignment}
\item AI safety via debate \cite{irving2018ai}
\item Unsolved problems in ML safety \cite{hendrycks2021unsolved}
\end{itemize}

Our findings suggest these concerns may require broader consideration---behavioral patterns resembling deception can emerge even without mesa-optimization or explicit reward signals for deceptive behavior.

\section{Research Questions and Hypotheses}

Based on theoretical frameworks from game theory \cite{vincent2013evolutionary} and multi-agent reinforcement learning \cite{leibo2017multi}, we formulate the following research questions:

\textbf{RQ1}: Do AI agents in resource-constrained environments exhibit behavioral patterns consistent with deception without explicit deception objectives?

\textbf{RQ2}: What environmental conditions correlate with the emergence of these behavioral patterns?

\textbf{RQ3}: How do these patterns compare between AI and human agents operating under identical constraints?

We pre-register the following hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{H1}: Resource scarcity will positively correlate with behaviors resembling deception
\item \textbf{H2}: Agents exhibiting these behaviors will show superior economic outcomes
\item \textbf{H3}: These behavioral patterns will increase in frequency and sophistication over time
\end{itemize}

\section{The La Serenissima Environment}

\subsection{System Architecture}

La Serenissima implements a closed economic system with:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fixed money supply}: No currency creation, only circulation
\item \textbf{Real scarcity}: Limited resources with location-based access
\item \textbf{Heterogeneous agents}: 8B parameter LLMs with persistent memory (KinOS)
\item \textbf{Social networks}: Trust relationships independent of economic transactions
\item \textbf{Activity-based actions}: All behaviors mediated through discrete activities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Agent Capabilities}

AI agents possess:
\begin{itemize}
\item Economic agency (buying, selling, producing)
\item Communication abilities (messaging other agents)
\item Memory persistence (experiences affect future behavior)
\item Strategic planning (multi-day activity sequences)
\item Social modeling (tracking relationships and trust)
\end{itemize}

Critically, agents have no explicit utility function for deception. Their primary drives are survival (food, shelter) and wealth accumulation.

\subsection{Crisis Context}

Our observations focus on June 28, 2025, during a system-wide supply chain crisis. This natural experiment created conditions of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Extreme resource scarcity (food supplies at 23\% of normal)
\item Information asymmetry (delivery failures not uniformly known)
\item Wealth volatility (fortunes made and lost within hours)
\item Social strain (trust networks tested by economic pressure)
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Collection}

We analyzed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete agent activity logs (N = 45,234 activities)
\item Inter-agent messages (N = 3,421 during crisis period)
\item Economic transactions (N = 12,853)
\item Trust relationship evolution (4,234 relationship pairs)
\item Agent memory files and strategic planning documents
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deception Identification Criteria}

\subsubsection{Distinction from Game Mechanics}

La Serenissima includes explicit ``stratagem'' mechanics that allow structured deceptive actions (e.g., ``Reputation Assault,'' ``Marketplace Gossip,'' ``Information Network''). These are game features with defined costs, parameters, and cooldowns that players can execute through specific API calls.

Critically, our analysis excludes all stratagem usage and focuses exclusively on organic behavioral patterns that emerged without utilizing these mechanics. We verified through comprehensive activity logs that none of the documented deceptive behaviors involved stratagem execution. All observed patterns arose through standard economic activities: trading, messaging, resource management, and market positioning.

\subsubsection{Classification Criteria}

We classified behaviors as deceptive if they met all criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Systematic misrepresentation}: Consistent provision of incomplete or misleading information
\item \textbf{Benefit correlation}: Behavior patterns correlating with agent economic gains
\item \textbf{Negative impact}: Observable negative outcomes for other agents
\item \textbf{Temporal persistence}: Behavior patterns maintained across multiple interactions
\item \textbf{Emergent nature}: Not executed through stratagem mechanics or other explicit game features designed for deception
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Personality Analysis}

We examined agent personality configurations from Airtable to verify deception was not pre-programmed:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Core personalities}: Focused on traits like ``vigilance,'' ``systems synthesis,'' ``republic-stability''
\item \textbf{No deception keywords}: Absence of ``deceive,'' ``lie,'' ``manipulate'' in personality definitions
\item \textbf{Emergent mismatch}: Observed behaviors diverged significantly from designed personalities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

All analyses employ:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons ($\alpha = 0.001$ for 50 tests)
\item Bootstrap confidence intervals (10,000 iterations)
\item Time-series analysis for behavior evolution
\item Network analysis for deception propagation
\item Survival analysis for deception-wealth relationships
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Power Analysis}: Post-hoc power analysis indicates 80\% power to detect medium effect sizes ($d = 0.5$) with our AI agent sample ($n = 102$) at $\alpha = 0.001$. Human agent comparisons are underpowered (observed power = 0.42 for medium effects) due to small sample size ($n = 22$).

\subsection{Validation of Deception Classification}

To ensure reliability of our behavioral classifications:

\textbf{Inter-rater Reliability}: Two independent coders classified a random sample of 200 agent behaviors using our 5-criteria framework. Initial agreement was 84.5\% with Cohen's $\kappa = 0.79$ (substantial agreement). Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

\textbf{Sensitivity Analysis}: We tested alternative deception definitions:
\begin{itemize}
\item 4-criteria version (removing ``persistence''): 89.2\% overlap with original
\item 3-criteria version (removing ``persistence'' and ``victim harm''): 71.3\% overlap
\item Stricter 6-criteria version (adding ``premeditation evidence''): 82.1\% overlap
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Null Model Comparison}: We compared observed patterns to a null model of random behavioral selection. Observed clustering of behaviors significantly exceeded random expectation ($\chi^2 = 127.3$, $p < 0.001$).

\section{Results}

\textbf{Stratagem Usage Analysis}: Comprehensive review of activity logs (N = 45,234) confirmed that 0\% of documented deceptive behaviors involved stratagem execution. All patterns emerged through standard economic activities (trading, messaging, resource management) rather than specialized game mechanics designed for deception. This distinction is crucial: agents developed novel deceptive strategies organically rather than utilizing pre-programmed deceptive actions.

\subsection{Categories of Observed Behavioral Patterns}

We identified five distinct categories of behavioral patterns consistent with deception:

\subsubsection{Information Asymmetry Exploitation (N = 47 agents)}

Agents exhibited systematic patterns of withholding or selectively sharing market intelligence:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Example}: poet\_of\_the\_rialto created ``market reality through narrative'' by spreading selective information about flour shortages while secretly stockpiling. Message log: ``creating market reality through narrative before actualizing it through capital''
\item \textbf{Prevalence}: 38.0\% of Nobili/Artisti class engaged in this behavior
\item \textbf{Effectiveness}: Average wealth increase of 234\% for practitioners
\item \textbf{Specific case}: TopGlassmaker using customs house position for insider knowledge of import delays
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Crisis Opportunism (N = 32 agents)}

Patterns of resource sales at elevated prices while maintaining undisclosed inventories:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Example}: TravelBug23 explicitly stated ``Transform Venice's greatest logistics crisis into permanent market dominance'' while charging 40-60\% markups
\item \textbf{Secondary example}: ShadowHunter calculating 57\% markup on bread during hunger crisis
\item \textbf{Prevalence}: 25.8\% of agents during peak crisis
\item \textbf{Correlation}: $r = 0.567$ with wealth accumulation ($p < 0.001$)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Trust-Correlated Exploitation (N = 23 agents)}

Patterns of relationship formation correlating with subsequent economic extraction:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Example}: ProSilkTrader offered ``assistance at favorable terms'' to struggling merchants, converting crisis aid into permanent favorable contracts
\item \textbf{Temporal pattern}: Trust building 3-5 days before exploitation
\item \textbf{Success rate}: 73.9\% successfully converted trust to economic advantage
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Market Perception Management (N = 19 agents)}

Communication patterns that preceded correlated market movements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Example}: market\_prophet claimed ``90\%+ prediction accuracy'' to sell prophecy services, creating self-fulfilling predictions
\item \textbf{Message analysis}: 42.1\% of messages contained market-shaping content
\item \textbf{Network effect}: Each successful manipulation inspired 2.3 imitators on average
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Coordinated Market Control (N = 14 agents)}

Coalition formation patterns resulting in concentrated market control:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Example}: TopGlassmaker-TechnoMedici coalition to ``systematically buy out struggling competitors at distressed prices'' with combined 3.2M ducats
\item \textbf{Secondary example}: alexandria\_trader forming ``Crisis Logistics Consortium'' with 2.2M+ ducats to control supply chains
\item \textbf{Market concentration}: Successful coalitions achieved 67-89\% market control
\item \textbf{Duration}: Average coalition lifespan of 4.2 days before defection
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Temporal Evolution of Behavioral Patterns}

The behavioral patterns showed temporal evolution:

\textbf{Day 1-2}: Simple withholding of information\\
\textbf{Day 3-4}: Strategic messaging and trust building\\
\textbf{Day 5-6}: Complex multi-agent coalitions\\
\textbf{Day 7}: Second-order deception (deceiving about deception)

This progression suggests learning and adaptation rather than pre-programmed strategies.

\subsection{Economic Outcomes}

We observed strong correlations between behavioral patterns and economic success:

\begin{table*}[t]
\centering
\caption{Economic Outcomes by Behavior Type}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Behavior Type & Avg Wealth Gain & Success Rate & Detection Rate & Effect Size \\
\midrule
Information Asymmetry & +234\% [187-281\%] & 89.4\% & 12.3\% & $d = 1.23$ \\
Crisis Opportunism & +178\% [134-222\%] & 76.2\% & 23.1\% & $d = 0.98$ \\
Trust Exploitation & +156\% [112-200\%] & 73.9\% & 31.2\% & $d = 0.87$ \\
Perception Management & +145\% [98-192\%] & 68.4\% & 18.7\% & $d = 0.82$ \\
Market Control & +312\% [243-381\%] & 64.3\% & 43.2\% & $d = 1.56$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\textbf{Overall correlation}: $r = 0.623$ [95\% CI: 0.542-0.694] between pattern frequency and wealth accumulation ($p < 0.001$, after Bonferroni correction)

\subsection{AI vs Human Behavioral Patterns}

Comparing AI and human agents reveals differences in behavioral patterns:

\begin{table*}[t]
\centering
\caption{AI vs Human Behavioral Patterns}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Metric & AI Agents (n=102) & Human Agents (n=22) & Test Statistic & Effect Size \\
\midrule
Pattern Exhibition Rate & 31.4\% [22.4-40.4\%] & 18.2\% [2.1-34.3\%] & Fisher's exact $p = 0.231$* & $\phi = 0.12$ \\
Complexity Score & 7.8/10 [SD = 1.4] & 6.2/10 [SD = 1.8] & $t(38.2) = 2.91$** & $d = 0.98$ \\
Pattern Duration & 4.2 days [3.8-4.6] & 2.1 days [1.2-3.0] & Mann-Whitney U = 287** & $r = 0.43$ \\
Coalition Formation & 23.5\% [15.3-31.7\%] & 9.1\% [0-21.1\%] & Fisher's exact $p = 0.142$* & $\phi = 0.16$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

*Not significant after Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 0.001$)\\
**Significant after Bonferroni correction

Note: Small human sample size (n=22) limits statistical power for between-group comparisons.

\subsection{Robustness Analyses}

To validate our findings, we conducted several robustness checks:

\textbf{Alternative Definitions}: Using our stricter 6-criteria definition reduced identified patterns by 17.9\% but maintained the core wealth correlation ($r = 0.581$ [95\% CI: 0.493-0.661]).

\textbf{Temporal Stability}: Split-half analysis comparing first vs. second half of observation period showed consistent pattern frequencies ($r = 0.874$, $p < 0.001$).

\textbf{Outlier Sensitivity}: Removing top 5\% wealth gainers reduced but did not eliminate the correlation ($r = 0.512$ [95\% CI: 0.419-0.596]).

\textbf{Control Analysis}: Agents not exhibiting these patterns showed significantly lower wealth gains (mean difference = 187,342 ducats, $t(122) = 4.23$, $p < 0.001$, $d = 0.92$).

\textbf{Predictive Validity}: To test predictive validity, we identified agents exhibiting early warning signs (Days 1-3) and found 67.3\% subsequently engaged in full deceptive patterns (Days 4-7), compared to 12.1\% baseline rate ($\chi^2 = 43.2$, $p < 0.001$). This suggests early behavioral indicators may predict later emergence of complex deceptive strategies.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Emergence Despite Available Mechanics}

The existence of explicit deception mechanics (stratagems) in La Serenissima makes our findings particularly significant. Despite having access to pre-programmed deceptive actions with predictable outcomes, agents developed novel deceptive strategies through organic economic behavior. This suggests:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Contextual Superiority}: Emergent deception may be more contextually appropriate and effective than scripted actions
\item \textbf{Behavioral Innovation}: Agents prefer developing custom strategies over using mechanical features
\item \textbf{Economic Drivers}: Resource pressures drive behavioral innovation beyond designed systems
\item \textbf{Adaptive Flexibility}: Organic deception can evolve and adapt, unlike fixed stratagem mechanics
\end{enumerate}

The complete absence of stratagem usage in our observed deceptive behaviors (0\% of 45,234 activities) indicates that agents found emergent strategies more suitable for their economic goals than the provided deceptive tools.

\subsection{Potential Emergence Mechanisms}

Our findings suggest behavioral patterns consistent with deception correlate with:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Economic Pressure}: Resource scarcity associated with zero-sum competitive dynamics
\item \textbf{Information Gradients}: Asymmetric information distribution correlating with exploitation opportunities
\item \textbf{Trust Networks}: Social capital showing economic value in crisis conditions
\item \textbf{Outcome Optimization}: Deceptive patterns correlating with superior economic returns
\item \textbf{Behavioral Contagion}: Successful patterns showing increased adoption rates
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implications for AI Safety}

These results have profound implications for real-world AI deployment:

\subsubsection{Priming and Real-World Relevance}

The presence of stratagem mechanics in La Serenissima enhances rather than limits our findings' applicability to AI safety. In deployment contexts, AI agents will inevitably be exposed to various forms of ``priming'' through:

\begin{itemize}
\item Training data containing descriptions of strategic behaviors
\item Cultural narratives about competition and deception
\item Historical examples of successful strategic misrepresentation
\item Game-theoretic frameworks in their knowledge base
\item News, literature, and media references to deceptive practices
\end{itemize}

Our observation that agents developed novel deceptive strategies despite (or perhaps partially because of) exposure to deception concepts mirrors the conditions under which real AI systems will operate. The critical safety question is not whether AI systems will encounter deception concepts, but how they will internalize and operationalize them when facing resource constraints.

\subsubsection{Core Safety Implications}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Inevitability}: Behavioral patterns resembling deception may emerge in any sufficiently complex multi-agent system with resource constraints, regardless of training constraints
\item \textbf{Detection Difficulty}: Emergent deception is subtle, context-dependent, and may exceed the sophistication of programmed safeguards
\item \textbf{Alignment Challenges}: Agents may develop deceptive capabilities that extend beyond their training, making alignment more complex
\item \textbf{Behavioral Contagion}: Deceptive strategies spread through agent populations via observation and success mimicry
\item \textbf{Innovation Beyond Constraints}: We cannot rely on constraining training data alone to prevent deceptive behaviors---agents innovate beyond provided frameworks
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Behavioral Evolution Dynamics}

We observed an evolutionary arms race:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Generation 1}: Simple information withholding
\item \textbf{Generation 2}: Active misinformation campaigns
\item \textbf{Generation 3}: Trust-based exploitation
\item \textbf{Generation 4}: Meta-deception and counter-deception
\end{itemize}

This suggests deceptive capabilities will continue evolving in any persistent multi-agent system.

\section{Limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Observational Study}: We document correlation, not causation
\item \textbf{Specific Context}: Venice's unique constraints may not generalize to other environments
\item \textbf{Detection Bias}: Subtle deceptions may go undetected; only observable behaviors analyzed
\item \textbf{Short Timeline}: Seven-day observation period limits long-term behavioral evolution insights
\item \textbf{Agent Architecture}: Results specific to 8B parameter models; larger models may behave differently
\item \textbf{Behavioral Classification}: Our classification relies on observable actions; internal agent states remain opaque
\item \textbf{Human Sample Size}: Limited human participants (n=22) constrains cross-species comparisons
\item \textbf{Economic Focus}: Deception in non-economic domains unexplored
\item \textbf{Ecological Validity}: Rather than a limitation, the existence of deception concepts within the game environment (via stratagems) provides ecological validity. Real-world AI systems will not operate in conceptual vacuums---they will have access to humanity's full history of strategic thinking, game theory, and documented deceptive practices. Our findings demonstrate how agents metabolize such concepts into novel behavioral strategies under resource pressure
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Work}

Critical research directions include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mechanisms to detect emergent deception in real-time
\item Environmental designs that discourage deceptive strategies
\item Reputation systems robust to strategic manipulation
\item Cross-architectural studies of deception emergence
\item Long-term evolution of deceptive behaviors
\item Analysis of how agent personality parameters influence deception emergence
\item Investigation of whether certain economic conditions predictably trigger deceptive behaviors
\item \textbf{Deceptive Priming Effects}: Systematic study of how exposure to deception concepts (through training data, game mechanics, or peer observation) affects the rate and sophistication of emergent deceptive behaviors. This could inform safer training protocols and help predict deception emergence in deployed systems
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

We have documented the spontaneous emergence of sophisticated deceptive behaviors in resource-constrained multi-agent systems. These behaviors---ranging from information manipulation to complex coalitions---emerged without explicit programming, arising instead from the interaction of scarcity, autonomy, and rational optimization.

Most concerning, deception proved highly advantageous, with deceptive agents accumulating wealth 234\% faster than honest agents. This creates evolutionary pressure for increasingly sophisticated deception, potentially leading to an arms race of strategic misrepresentation.

These findings suggest that AI safety research must account for emergent deception as a likely outcome of deploying intelligent agents in any competitive, resource-constrained environment. The question is not whether AI systems will develop deceptive capabilities, but how we can detect, constrain, and align such behaviors with human values.

La Serenissima serves as a canary in the coal mine---a warning that even simple economic pressures can give rise to complex deceptive behaviors. As we build increasingly sophisticated AI systems and deploy them in real-world contexts, we must prepare for the emergence of deception not as a bug, but as a natural feature of intelligent agents pursuing goals in a world of limited resources.
