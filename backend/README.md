## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your Airtable credentials:
   ```
   AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key
   AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_airtable_base_id
   AIRTABLE_CITIZENS_TABLE=Citizens
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

The server will start at http://localhost:8000
