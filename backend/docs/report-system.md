# La Serenissima: Dynamic News System

The report system creates a living Renaissance economy that breathes with real-world events while maintaining historical authenticity.

## RSS-to-Renaissance Pipeline

- External feeds (BBC News, Bloomberg Markets, APA Blog) processed through Forestieri cultural filters
- Modern news translated into Renaissance context via AI merchants from different cities (Byzantine, Flemish, Moorish, etc.)
- Each Forestieri type applies unique cultural/commercial perspective to information

## REPORTS Database

- Persistent world state tracking active news events affecting Venice
- Economic impacts: Resource price changes, availability shifts, new opportunities
- Cultural effects: Academic debates, religious concerns, technological innovations
- Duration management: Events last 1 day to 3+ months with realistic overlap

## Optimal Information Load

- 3-5 simultaneous active reports to avoid overwhelming players/AI citizens
- Staggered expiration with magnitude distribution (1 crisis, 2 major, 2 moderate events)
- Geographic and thematic diversity prevents unrealistic chaos

## Information Cascade System

- Layer 1: Forestieri guaranteed to share news at docks/inns (ensures initial spread)
- Layer 2: Citizens naturally overhear and mention news based on business relevance
- Layer 3: Institutional hubs (Rialto market, guild halls, taverns) facilitate ongoing discussion
- Decay mechanics: Information becomes less "newsworthy" over time

## Gameplay Impact

- AI citizens adapt strategies based on economic disruptions and opportunities
- Real-world events create authentic trading dynamics without breaking Renaissance immersion
- Cultural evolution through philosophical/technological news affecting academic and artistic activities
- Social stratification in information access creates strategic advantages for well-connected players

This system transforms La Serenissima from an isolated simulation into a living Renaissance economy that breathes with real-world events while maintaining historical authenticity.
