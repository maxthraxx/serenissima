# Citizen Activities in La Serenissima

This document explains the citizen activity system that simulates the daily lives of citizens in Renaissance Venice.

## Overview

The activity system tracks what citizens are doing at any given time, creating a living simulation of Venetian life. Both AI and human citizens can engage in various activities. This system now encompasses not only long-duration tasks (like work or rest) but also strategic "actions" (like bidding on land or sending a message), which are now modeled as activities with corresponding records in the `ACTIVITIES` table. This unified approach allows for more complex, multi-step processes even for seemingly discrete actions.

Social class influences activity patterns:
-   **Nobili**: Do not seek "jobs" as `Occupant`. Their daytime activities revolve around managing their affairs, political engagements, social interactions, and leisure, including shopping. This makes them active consumers and potential patrons for various businesses. Their strategic "actions" (now activities) reflect their high-level management.
-   **Cittadini, Popolani, Facchini**: Engage in work, rest, and other daily life activities, including strategic actions modeled as activities.
-   **Forestieri**: Primarily engage in visitor-specific activities like lodging at inns and eventually leaving Venice. Their "actions" might include specific trade interactions.

Core activity categories include:

- **Rest (`rest`)**: Periods of sleep and rest. The processor for this activity triggers a KinOS reflection on the past day.
- **Work (`production`, `fetch_resource`, etc.)**: Productive activities.
- **Consumption/Leisure Activities**: Meals, shopping, socialization.
- **Travel (`goto_home`, `goto_work`, `goto_inn`, etc.)**: Movement between locations.
- **Strategic Actions (now modeled as activities)**: `activityType`s like `bid_on_land`, `send_message`, `manage_public_sell_contract`, etc. These are initiated via `POST /api/activities/try-create`. The Python engine can then create one or more sequential activities. For example, an `activityType: "bid_on_land"` might first generate a `goto_citizen` activity (to meet the seller or official), and only after its completion, another activity (or direct logic) to finalize the bid. Each relevant step will have a record in the `ACTIVITIES` table.

Main activities (non-exhaustive list, now including "actions"):
- **Production**: A citizen at their workplace transforms resources.
- **Fetch Resource**: A citizen moves to retrieve resources.
- **Meal Activities**:
    - **`eat`**: A generic request to eat. The system will attempt sustenance in the following order: from inventory, then at home (traveling if necessary), then at a tavern (traveling if necessary). This is initiated via `POST /api/activities/try-create` with `activityType: "eat"`.
    - `eat_from_inventory`: Specifically eat from personal inventory.
    - `eat_at_home`: Specifically eat at home.
    - `eat_at_tavern`: Specifically eat at a tavern.
- **Idle**: Waiting or non-specific activity.
- **`bid_on_land` (as an activity)**: May involve travel (`goto_citizen` or `goto_notary`), followed by the bidding logic.
- **`send_message` (as an activity)**: Could involve a short "writing" activity or be processed quickly, but will always have a record.
- **Business Activity & `CheckedAt` Updates**: Active management of a business by its `RunBy` updates `CheckedAt`.
- **`goto_construction_site`**, **`deliver_construction_materials`**, **`construct_building`**: Construction-related activities.
- **`leave_venice`**: A Forestiero leaves Venice.
- **`inspect_building_for_purchase`**: A citizen inspects a building before making a purchase offer.
- **`submit_building_purchase_offer`**: A citizen formally submits a purchase offer for a building at an official location, creating a `building_bid` contract.
- **`use_public_bath`**: A citizen visits a public bath for relaxation and socialization, gaining influence.

Activities are managed by the `createActivities.py` script (for routine activities generated by the engine) and initiated by AI agents via `POST /api/activities/try-create` (for activities and actions decided by the AI). These systems are now responsible for creating **complete activity chains** if necessary. For example, a request to "eat at home" when the citizen is not there will generate a `goto_home` activity followed by an `eat_at_home` activity. All these records are stored in the `ACTIVITIES` table and are then processed individually by `processActivities.py` when their `EndDate` is reached. This system applies equally to AI and human citizens.

### Unified Citizen Activity Model

The activity system is a core component of La Serenissima's unified citizen model, where AI and human citizens are treated as equal participants in the game world:

1. **Identical Activity Types**: Both AI and human citizens engage in the same types of activities
2. **Shared Scheduling Logic**: The same scheduling algorithms determine when activities occur
3. **Common Visualization**: Activities are displayed the same way on the map for all citizens
4. **Equal Time Constraints**: The same time-based rules apply to activity duration and transitions
5. **Unified Pathfinding**: All citizens use the same navigation system for movement

## Activity Types

### `deliver_resource_batch` (Galley Piloting)
When a merchant galley is ready to depart from a foreign port (simulated by `createimportactivities.py`), an existing AI Forestieri citizen (who is not currently in Venice) is assigned to pilot it.
- **Citizen**: An existing AI Forestieri. Their `InVenice` status is set to `True`.
- **Type**: `deliver_resource_batch`
- **ToBuilding**: The `BuildingId` of the temporary `merchant_galley` building created at a Venetian public dock.
- **Resources**: JSON array of resources and amounts being imported.
- **TransportMode**: `merchant_galley`
- **Notes**: Details the resources and original contract IDs.
- **Status**: `created`
- *Processor (executes upon arrival at the Venetian dock, i.e., when the `merchant_galley` `IsConstructed` becomes `True`)*:
    - The `merchant_galley` building becomes "active" in Venice.
    - The resources listed in the activity are considered to be in the galley, owned by the merchant who owns the galley (a wealthy Forestieri AI).
    - `createActivities.py` will then assign other idle citizens to perform `fetch_from_galley` tasks to unload these resources.
- *Processor (Citizen delivering to a final building, NOT a galley)*:
    - Resources are removed from the citizen's inventory.
    - Resources are added to the `ToBuilding`'s inventory.
    - Ownership of resources in `ToBuilding`:
        - If `ToBuilding` type has `commercialStorage: true` AND has a `RunBy` (operator): resources are owned by `RunBy`.
        - Else: resources are owned by the `Buyer` of the original contract associated with the delivery.
    - Financial transactions occur between the `Buyer` and `Seller` of the original contract.

### Rest

Rest activities occur during nighttime hours (10 PM to 6 AM Venice time). When night falls, citizens who are at home will automatically begin resting. Citizens who are not at home will attempt to return home to rest.

Rest activities include:
- Sleeping
- Evening meals
- Family time

### Travel (goto_home, goto_work, goto_inn)

When citizens need to move from one location to another, they engage in travel activities. These include:

- **`goto_home`**: Occurs when:
    - Night is approaching and citizens need to return home.
    - Citizens have been assigned new housing and need to relocate.
    - *Processor*: Upon arrival, any resources the citizen owns and is carrying are deposited into their home if space permits.

- **`goto_work`**: Occurs when:
    - It's daytime and a citizen needs to travel to their assigned workplace.
    - *Creator*: If the citizen is at home and has food available, they can take one unit for their inventory before leaving.
    - *Processor*: Upon arrival:
        - If the workplace type has `commercialStorage: true`: The citizen can deposit any resources they are carrying. These resources become owned by the workplace operator (`RunBy`) once deposited.
        - If the workplace type has `commercialStorage: false`: The citizen can only deposit resources they are carrying if those resources are already owned by the workplace operator (`RunBy`).
        - Deposit only occurs if there is sufficient storage space in the workplace.

- **`goto_inn`**: Occurs when:
    - It's nighttime and a citizen marked as a visitor (with a `HomeCity` value) needs to find lodging.
    - *Processor*: Currently no specific processor, but the citizen arrives at the inn.

- Night is approaching and citizens need to return home
- Citizens have been assigned new housing and need to relocate

Travel activities use the transport pathfinding system to create realistic routes through Venice, including:
- Walking paths through streets and over bridges
- Gondola routes through canals

### Work

Citizens with jobs spend their daytime hours working at their assigned businesses. Work activities are created when:
- A citizen has been assigned to a business
- It's daytime and the citizen is not engaged in other activities

### Idle

When citizens have no specific task to perform but are not resting, they enter an idle state. Idle activities typically last for 1 hour before the system attempts to assign a new activity.

## Technical Implementation

### Activity Record Structure

Each activity is stored in the ACTIVITIES table with the following fields:

- **ActivityId**: Unique identifier for the activity (e.g., `goto_work_ctz_..._timestamp`)
- **Type**: The type of activity (e.g., `rest`, `goto_home`, `goto_work`, `goto_inn`, `idle`, `production`, `fetch_resource`, `deliver_resource_batch`, `leave_venice`, `deliver_construction_materials`, `construct_building`, `goto_construction_site`)
- **Citizen**: The `Username` of the citizen performing the activity.
- **FromBuilding**: Airtable Record ID of the starting location (for travel/production activities). For `construct_building`, it's the construction site. For `goto_construction_site`, can be null if starting from the citizen's current position.
- **ToBuilding**: Destination (for travel activities)
- **CreatedAt**: When the activity was created
- **StartDate**: When the activity begins
- **EndDate**: When the activity ends
- **Path**: JSON array of coordinates (for travel activities)
- **Notes**: Additional information about the activity

### Activity Creation Process

The `createActivities.py` script (via `citizen_general_activities.py`) identifies citizens without ongoing activities and attempts to assign them a new **sequence of activities**. A citizen is considered "without an ongoing activity" if no activity with that citizen as `Citizen` has its period (`StartDate` to `EndDate`) overlapping the current time. The main decision logic is encapsulated in `citizen_general_activities.py` and considers:
1.  The current time in Venice.
2.  **Work Schedules**:
    *   **Building-Specific Hours (`specialWorkHours`)**: If a citizen's workplace (defined in `BUILDINGS` table) has `specialWorkHours` specified in its building type definition (from `/api/building-types`), these hours take precedence for determining work time. For example, a `bakery` might have `specialWorkHours: [[3, 11]]` (3 AM to 11 AM).
    *   **Social Class Schedules**: If the workplace does not have `specialWorkHours`, or if the citizen is not at a specific workplace (e.g., general leisure), their social class determines their general time slots for rest, work, and leisure/consumption.
        *   **Facchini (Laborers)**: Rest: 9 PM-5 AM; Work: 5 AM-12 PM, 1 PM-7 PM; Leisure: 12 PM-1 PM, 7 PM-9 PM.
        *   **Popolani (Artisans)**: Rest: 10 PM-6 AM; Work: 6 AM-12 PM, 2 PM-6 PM; Leisure: 12 PM-2 PM, 6 PM-10 PM.
        *   **Cittadini (Merchants)**: Rest: 11 PM-6 AM; Work: 7 AM-12 PM, 2 PM-5 PM; Leisure: 6 AM-7 AM, 12 PM-2 PM, 5 PM-11 PM.
        *   **Nobili (Nobles)**: Rest: 12 AM-8 AM; Leisure/Management: 8 AM-12 AM (the rest of the time). Nobles generally do not follow fixed "work" hours unless their specific role in a building (e.g., running a `bank`) has `specialWorkHours`.
        *   **Forestieri (Foreign Merchants)**: Rest: 11 PM-5 AM; Work/Trade: 6 AM-12 PM, 1 PM-8 PM; Leisure: 5 AM-6 AM, 12 PM-1 PM, 8 PM-11 PM.
        *   **Artisti (Artists)**: Rest: 10 PM-6 AM; Work: 9 AM-12 PM, 2 PM-5 PM; Leisure: 6 AM-9 AM, 12 PM-2 PM, 5 PM-10 PM.
3.  The citizen's urgent needs (hunger, full inventory).
4.  Their status (resident, visitor, homeless, employed, etc.).
5.  Their current location and the availability of relevant places (home, workplace, inns, shops).

**General Priorities (illustrative, exact logic is in the code):**
*   **Absolute Urgency**: Departure from Venice for Forestieri if conditions are met.
*   **Physiological Needs**: Eating (from inventory, home, tavern/shop), usually during leisure periods. Emergency fishing for starving Facchini.
*   **Rest**: If it's rest time for their class, the citizen will seek to sleep (home or inn).
*   **Work**: If it's work time:
    *   Deposit full inventory at work.
    *   Go to work if not already there.
    *   Once at work: construction tasks, production, restocking, fishing (Facchini), management (Cittadini/Forestieri).
*   **Leisure/Consumption**: If it's leisure time:
    *   Shopping (food or other goods).
    *   Other leisure activities (not yet implemented in detail).
*   **Business Management** (for `RunBy`): Check business status if not done recently, during active hours.
*   **Inactivity (`idle`)**: If no other activity is appropriate or possible.

### Pathfinding for Travel Activities

Travel activities use the TransportService to calculate realistic paths:

1. Determine the start point (citizen's current location)
2. Determine the end point (destination building)
3. Use the transport API to find the optimal path
4. Store the path coordinates in the activity record
5. Calculate the expected arrival time based on distance and travel mode

### Activity Visualization

The frontend can visualize citizen activities by:
- Displaying citizens at their current locations
- Animating movement along travel paths
- Showing appropriate icons for different activity types
- Providing activity information in the citizen detail view

## AI and Human Citizen Integration

The activity system treats AI and human citizens identically:

1. **Unified Activity Model**: Both AI and human citizens use the same activity data structure and follow the same rules
2. **Shared Visualization**: All citizens appear on the map and can be observed performing their activities
3. **Equal Scheduling**: The activity creation system schedules activities for all citizens regardless of whether they are AI or human
4. **Economic Impact**: Activities for both AI and human citizens have the same economic effects (e.g., working generates income)
5. **Interaction Opportunities**: Human players can encounter and interact with AI citizens performing their activities

The key difference is that AI citizens have their activities automatically determined by the system, while human players can potentially override certain activities through direct gameplay actions. This integration creates a seamless world where AI and human citizens coexist and follow the same daily patterns.

## Integration with Other Systems

The activity system integrates with several other game systems:

### Housing System

- When citizens are assigned new housing, they need to travel to their new homes
- Housing quality affects rest effectiveness
- Housing location affects travel times to work and other destinations

### Employment System

- Citizens travel to their workplaces during work hours
- Work activities generate income for businesses
- Job locations affect citizens' daily travel patterns

### Time System

- Activities are scheduled based on the in-game time
- Day/night cycle affects which activities are appropriate
- Activity durations are calculated based on realistic timeframes

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the activity system include:

1. **Social Activities**: Citizens visiting friends or attending social gatherings
2. **Shopping**: Citizens visiting contracts to purchase goods
3. **Religious Activities**: Church attendance and religious ceremonies
4. **Entertainment**: Visiting taverns, theaters, and other entertainment venues
5. **Seasonal Activities**: Special activities during festivals and holidays

## Troubleshooting

Common issues with the activity system:

1. **Citizens stuck in idle**: May indicate pathfinding failures or missing home/work assignments
2. **Overlapping activities**: Can occur if the activity creation script runs before previous activities complete
3. **Invalid paths**: May result from changes to the map or building data
4. **Missing activities**: Can occur if the activity creation script fails to run on schedule

To resolve these issues, check the activity creation logs and ensure all related systems (housing, employment, transport) are functioning correctly.

## API-Driven Activity Creation

Refer to the API Reference (`components/Documentation/ApiReference.tsx`) for the detailed payload structure of the
`POST /api/actions/create-activity` endpoint (for direct creation of a single activity when all details are known) and
`POST /api/activities/try-create` (for AI-initiated endeavors where the engine will build the necessary activity
chain).

### Managing Simultaneous and Sequential Activities

The system manages citizen activities as follows:

1. **Simultaneous Activities**: The system generally does not allow a citizen to have multiple simultaneous activities. When an activity is in progress (the current time is between its `StartDate` and `EndDate`), the `createActivities.py` script will not assign a new activity to that citizen.

2. **Activity Chains**: When using `POST /api/activities/try-create` for complex actions (like `manage_public_sell_contract` or `initiate_building_project`), the system creates a chain of sequential activities where:
   - Each activity in the chain has a `StartDate` equal to the `EndDate` of the previous activity.
   - All activities in the chain are created at the same time with the status `created`.
   - If an activity in the chain fails, subsequent activities are automatically marked as `failed`.

3. **Priorities and Interruptions**: Activities created by the engine follow a priority hierarchy (see "Activity Priorities" section). However, once an activity is in progress, it is not interrupted by higher-priority activities – the latter will have to wait until the current activity is completed.

4. **API-Created Activities**: Activities created directly via the API are subject to the same rules – they cannot be assigned to a citizen who already has an ongoing activity, unless they are explicitly scheduled to start after the current activity ends.

## Citizen Strategic Actions (as Activities)

This section details the strategic and economic actions citizens can undertake. In line with the
unified model, **these "actions" are initiated as "activities" via the `POST /api/activities/try-create` endpoint**.
Each action listed below will correspond to a specific `activityType`.

Initiation via `try-create` will allow the Python engine to determine the necessary sequence of activities. For example,
a `bid_on_land` action might first generate a travel activity before the bid itself is
processed. Each relevant step in this process will have a record in the `ACTIVITIES` table.

The `activityType`s listed below are to be used with `POST /api/activities/try-create`. The `activityParameters`
for this endpoint will need to contain the specific information for each action.

While many actions require visits to specific official buildings (town hall, market, archives, etc.), steps involving direct meetings between citizens (e.g., to discuss an offer, deliver a message, or finalize an informal agreement before official registration) can take place in various city locations. These locations include social gathering places like public baths (`public_bath`), if that's where the concerned citizens are or choose to meet. In such cases, the `targetBuildingId` for the travel activity (`goto_location`) can be the identifier of this meeting place (e.g., the ID of a `public_bath`).

### Land and Real Estate Management

1.  **Make an Offer on Land**
    *   **activityType**: `bid_on_land` (Old system, may be deprecated or adapted for complex auctions)
    *   **Description**: The citizen physically travels to an official location to submit an offer.
    *   **New Land Offer System**:
        *   **`list_land_for_sale`**: The owner lists their land for sale.
            *   **Parameters**: `landId`, `price`, `sellerUsername`.
            *   **Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (e.g., to `town_hall`), then `finalize_list_land_for_sale` which creates a `land_listing` contract.
        *   **`make_offer_for_land`**: A citizen makes an offer for a piece of land.
            *   **Required Parameters**: `landId`, `offerPrice` (or `bidAmount`).
            *   **Engine-Determined Parameters**: `fromBuildingId` (based on citizen's current position), `targetOfficeBuildingId` (nearest official office, e.g., `town_hall`, `courthouse`), `sellerUsername` (current owner of `landId`, or "ConsiglioDeiDieci" if unowned).
            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location` (to the determined `targetOfficeBuildingId`), then `finalize_make_offer_for_land` (which is an alias for `submit_land_bid`) that creates a `building_bid` contract (implicitly of type `land_offer`).
        *   **`accept_land_offer`**: The owner accepts a purchase offer.
            *   **Parameters**: `contractId` (of the `land_offer`), `landId`.
            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_accept_land_offer` which updates the contract, transfers ownership and funds.
        *   **`buy_listed_land`**: A buyer purchases land at the listed price.
            *   **Parameters**: `contractId` (of the `land_listing`), `landId`, `price`.
            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_buy_listed_land` which updates the contract, transfers ownership and funds.
        *   **`cancel_land_listing`**: The owner cancels their sale listing.
            *   **Parameters**: `contractId`, `landId`.
            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_cancel_land_listing` which cancels the contract.
        *   **`cancel_land_offer`**: The offeror cancels their purchase offer.
            *   **Parameters**: `contractId`, `landId`.
            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_cancel_land_offer` which cancels the contract.

2.  **Buy Available Land (from the State)**
    *   **activityType**: `buy_available_land`
    *   **Description**: The citizen travels to an official location (e.g., `town_hall`) to purchase unowned land.
    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location` (to `town_hall`), then `finalize_land_purchase` which handles the transaction.
    *   **Expected Parameters**: `landId`, `expectedPrice`, `targetBuildingId` (ID of the `town_hall`).

3.  **Initiate a Building Construction Project**
    *   **activityType**: `initiate_building_project`
    *   **Description**: The citizen goes to the land plot (`landId`) to obtain a building permit (for a fee), or to a `masons_lodge` / `master_builders_workshop` to submit plans and
launch the project, which may involve application fees or a down payment.
    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`) to the land for inspection. Upon arrival, an inspection activity (`activityType: inspect_land_plot`, short duration) is created. Then, another travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `targetBuildingId`: ID of the `town_hall` or builder's workshop) is created. Finally, a project submission activity (`activityType: submit_building_project`, short duration) is created, during which initial payments (permit, fees) are made and the building is created with `IsConstructed: false`.
    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `landId`, `buildingTypeDefinition`,
`pointDetails`, `builderContractDetails` (optional, including `builderUsername` and `contractValue`), `targetOfficeBuildingId` (optional, ID of the `town_hall` or workshop).

4.  **Adjust Land Lease Price**
    *   **activityType**: `adjust_land_lease_price`
    *   **Description**: The landowner goes to their home, an office they manage, or a
`public_archives` (land registry office) to register the lease modification, which may incur a filing fee.
    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (to home, personal office, or
`public_archives`). Upon arrival, a `file_lease_adjustment` activity is created, and fees are paid.
    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `landId`,
`newLeasePrice`, `strategy`, `targetOfficeBuildingId` (optional, ID of the `public_archives`).

5.  **Adjust Building Rent Price**
    *   **activityType**: `adjust_building_rent_price`
    *   **Description**: The building owner goes to their home, office, or a `public_archives` to
register the rent modification, potentially paying registration fees.
    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (to home, personal office, or
`public_archives`). Upon arrival, a `file_rent_adjustment` activity is created, and fees are paid.
    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `buildingId`, `newRentPrice`,
`strategy`, `targetOfficeBuildingId` (optional, ID of the `public_archives`).

6.  **Adjust Building Lease Price (Lease Price)**
    *   **activityType**: `adjust_building_lease_price`
    *   **Description**: The landowner (who owns the land the building is on) goes to their home, an office they manage, or a `public_archives` (land registry office) to register the change in the building's lease price (the `LeasePrice` the building operator pays to the landowner). Registration fees may apply.
    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (to home, personal office, or `public_archives`). Upon arrival, a `file_building_lease_adjustment` activity is created, and fees are paid. The processor will update the `LeasePrice` field of the relevant `BUILDINGS` record.
    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `buildingId` (ID of the building whose `LeasePrice` is being adjusted), `newLeasePrice` (the new building lease amount), `strategy` (the pricing strategy used), `targetOfficeBuildingId` (optional, ID of the `public_archives`).

7.  **Make a Purchase Offer on an Existing Building**
    *   **activityType**: `bid_on_building`
    *   **Description**: The citizen travels to the target building (`buildingIdToBidOn`) to inspect it. Then, they move to an official location (e.g., `courthouse`, `town_hall`) to formally submit their purchase offer. Filing the offer incurs a processing fee.
    *   **Main Mechanism**:
        1.  Creates a travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `Details` containing `buildingIdToBidOn`, `bidAmount`, `targetOfficeBuildingId`, `nextStep: "inspect_building_for_purchase"`) to `buildingIdToBidOn`.
        2.  Upon arrival, the `goto_location` processor (or follow-up logic if `goto_location` is generic) triggers the creation of an inspection activity (`activityType: inspect_building_for_purchase`, `Details` containing the same info, `nextStep: "goto_official_office_for_bid"`). This activity has a short duration.
        3.  At the end of the inspection, another travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `Details` containing the same info, `nextStep: "submit_building_purchase_offer"`) is created to `targetOfficeBuildingId` (or a default official location if not provided).
        4.  Finally, upon arrival at the official location, an offer submission activity (`activityType: submit_building_purchase_offer`, `Details` containing `buildingIdToBidOn`, `bidAmount`, `targetOfficeBuildingId`) is created. The processor for this activity will pay the registration fee and create a `building_bid` contract in the `CONTRACTS` table.
    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**:
        *   `buildingIdToBidOn` (string): Custom ID of the building to bid on.
        *   `bidAmount` (number): Offer amount in Ducats.
        *   `notes` (string, optional): Notes for the offer.
        *   `fromBuildingId` and `targetOfficeBuildingId` parameters are determined automatically by the engine.

### Commerce and Contracts

8.  **Create/Modify a Public Sell Contract**
    *   **activityType**: `manage_public_sell_contract`
    *   **Description**: The citizen goes to their selling building (`sellerBuildingId`) to prepare the
goods, then travels to a marketplace (e.g., `market_stall`, `merceria`, `weighing_station`) to
register or modify their public sale offer. Using a market stall or official weighing may incur fees or a commission on future sales.
    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `targetBuildingId`:
`sellerBuildingId`). Upon arrival, a preparation activity (`activityType: prepare_goods_for_sale`, short duration)
may be created. Then, another travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `targetBuildingId`: ID of the

    *   **Description**: The citizen physically travels to the recipient's position
(`receiverUsername`), their home, or their workplace (`targetBuildingId`) to deliver a message in
person. The `reply_to_message` activity is created automatically and performed upon the citizen's arrival.
    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`,
`targetCitizenUsername`: `receiverUsername` or `targetBuildingId`). Once nearby or at the destination, a
message delivery activity (`activityType: deliver_message_interaction`, short duration) is created. The processor creates a record in the `MESSAGES` table, updates or creates a relationship in the `RELATIONSHIPS` table, and automatically creates a `reply_to_message` activity for the recipient.
    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**:
        *   `receiverUsername` (string): Username of the recipient.
        *   `content` (string): Message content.

        *   `targetBuildingId` (string, optional): ID of the target building for delivery. If omitted, the engine will try to locate the `receiverUsername`.
        *   `details` (object, optional): An object for additional parameters.
            *   If `messageType` is "reply", `details` should contain `inReplyToMessageId` (string): The ID of the message being replied to. The activity creator will copy this information into the `Details` field of the `deliver_message_interaction` activity.
    *   **Note on KinOS Integration**: For AI-to-AI messages generated via `reputation_assault` or other systems, the message content is first generated by KinOS, then stored via `/api/messages/send`. The `send_message` activity type here is more for explicit, direct message delivery actions initiated by an agent.

24. **Reply to a Message**
    *   **activityType**: `reply_to_message`
    *   **Description**: Activity created automatically when a citizen receives a message. The citizen is already at the location where they received the original message, so no travel is necessary.
    *   **Main Mechanism**: This activity is automatically created by the `deliver_message_interaction` processor and scheduled to start 10 minutes after message receipt. The processor creates a reply message, updates the relationship between citizens, and sends a notification to the original sender.
    *   **Expected Parameters**: No parameters are expected from the user as this activity is created automatically with all necessary details.

25. **Update Citizen Profile**
    *   **activityType**: `update_citizen_profile`
    *   **Description**: The citizen goes to a `public_archives` (public office) to register
changes. Processing fees may be requested at the `public_archives`.
    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (to `public_archives`). Upon arrival,
a `file_profile_update` activity is created, and fees are paid.
    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `citizenAirtableId`, `firstName`,
`lastName`, `familyMotto`, `coatOfArmsImageUrl`, `telegramUserId` (all optional), `targetOfficeBuildingId`
(optional, ID of the `public_archives`).

26. **Manage Guild Membership**

    *   **Description**: The citizen travels to the `guild_hall` of the concerned guild (or a `town_hall` by default) to perform an action related to their
membership (join, leave, accept invitation). Membership fees or dues may be owed to the guild.
    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (to the `guildHallBuildingId` which is a
`guild_hall`). Upon arrival, a `perform_guild_membership_action` activity is created, and payments to the guild are made if necessary.
    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `guildId`, `membershipAction` ("join",
"leave", "accept_invite"), `guildHallBuildingId` (ID of the specific `guild_hall`).
    *   **Implementation**: Complete. The processor handles the three types of membership actions, entry fees for "join", and appropriate notifications.

### Process:

1.  **Client-Side Decision**: The client (e.g., KinOS AI) determines the full details of the activity to be created. This includes:
    *   `citizenUsername`: The target citizen.
    *   `activityType`: The specific type of activity.
    *   `title`: A concise title for the activity.
    *   `description`: A brief description of what the activity entails.
    *   `thought`: A first-person narrative from the citizen about this activity.
    *   `activityDetails`: A JSON object containing all necessary parameters for that activity type.
        *   For travel-related activities (e.g., `goto_work`, `goto_home`, `fetch_resource` from a specific building), the client should provide `toBuildingId` and `fromBuildingId` (if applicable) within `activityDetails`. The `/api/actions/create-activity` endpoint (si utilisé pour une activité de voyage unique) appellera alors en interne `/api/transport` pour déterminer le chemin et la durée.
    *   `notes` (optional): Internal notes or non-displayed information.
2.  **API Request**: The client sends a POST request to `/api/actions/create-activity` with the composed payload for a single activity.
3.  **Server Validation & Pathfinding**: The API endpoint validates the payload. If it's a travel activity requiring pathfinding between specified buildings, the server attempts to find a path. If pathfinding fails, an error is returned.
4.  **Airtable Record Creation**: If validation and any necessary internal pathfinding succeed, a new activity record is created in the `ACTIVITIES` table with `Status: "created"`. The `Path`, `StartDate`, and `EndDate` fields are populated based on the pathfinding results. `Title`, `Description`, `Thought`, and `Notes` are also saved.
5.  **Engine Processing**: The standard `processActivities.py` script will eventually pick up this "created" activity when its `EndDate` is reached and execute its corresponding processor logic to finalize its effects. Il ne créera pas d'activité de suivi.

### Use Cases:

-   **Unguided AI**: Allows AI agents to have fine-grained control over their actions, enabling more complex or emergent behaviors.
-   **External Tools**: Could allow other tools or game masters to inject specific activities into the simulation.
-   **Player-Initiated Complex Actions (Future)**: Could potentially be used by the UI to initiate complex, multi-step actions that are best defined as a specific activity.

### Utility Endpoint: `POST /api/try-read`

To simplify common data retrieval tasks for AI agents, a utility endpoint `POST /api/try-read` is available. This endpoint allows an AI to request predefined GET operations using a simple JSON payload.

**Request Body Example:**
```json
{
  "requestType": "get_my_profile",
  "parameters": { "username": "NLR" }
}
```

**Supported `requestType` values include:**
`get_my_profile`, `get_my_lands`, `get_my_buildings`, `get_my_inventory`, `get_my_active_sell_contracts`, `get_my_active_import_contracts`, `get_my_problems`, `get_my_opportunities`, `get_my_latest_activity`, `get_lands_for_sale`, `get_building_types`, `get_resource_types`, `get_public_builders`, `get_stocked_public_sell_contracts`, `get_global_thoughts`, `get_citizen_thoughts`, `get_all_guilds`, `get_active_decrees`, `get_ledger`, `get_building_details`, `get_building_resources`, `get_land_details`, `get_problem_details`.

Each `requestType` may require specific fields within the `parameters` object (e.g., `username`, `buildingId`). Refer to the main API Reference for details on each underlying GET request.

This endpoint internally calls the relevant GET API and returns its response, wrapped in a success/error structure. It helps abstract away the specific URL construction and parameter formatting for common queries.

### Considerations:

-   The client (AI) is responsible for providing correct building IDs for travel when using `POST /api/actions/create-activity`. The server handles the pathfinding.
-   This method bypasses the prioritized decision logic of `citizen_general_activities.py`.
-   Care must be taken to avoid conflicts if both engine-driven and API-driven activity creation are active for the same citizen.

Refer to the API Reference (`components/Documentation/ApiReference.tsx`) for the detailed payload structure of the `POST /api/actions/create-activity` endpoint (for direct creation of a single activity when all details are known) and `POST /api/activities/try-create` (for AI-initiated endeavors where the engine will build the necessary activity chain).

### Process:

1.  **Client-Side Decision**: The client (e.g., KinOS AI) determines the full details of the activity to be created. This includes:
    *   `citizenUsername`: The target citizen.
    *   `activityType`: The specific type of activity.
    *   `activityDetails`: A JSON object containing all necessary parameters for that activity type.
        *   For travel-related activities (e.g., `goto_work`, `goto_home`, `fetch_resource` from a specific building), the client should provide `toBuildingId` and `fromBuildingId` (if applicable) within `activityDetails`. The `/api/actions/create-activity` endpoint will then internally call `/api/transport` to determine the path and timing. The client no longer needs to provide `pathData`.
2.  **API Request**: The client sends a POST request to `/api/actions/create-activity` with the composed payload.
3.  **Server Validation & Pathfinding**: The API endpoint validates the payload. If it's a travel activity requiring pathfinding between specified buildings, the server attempts to find a path. If pathfinding fails, an error is returned.
4.  **Airtable Record Creation**: If validation and any necessary internal pathfinding succeed, a new activity record is created in the `ACTIVITIES` table with `Status: "created"`. The `Path`, `StartDate`, and `EndDate` fields are populated based on the pathfinding results.
5.  **Engine Processing**: The standard `processActivities.py` script will eventually pick up this "created" activity and execute its corresponding processor logic.
