# La Serenissima Resilience Implementation Plan

*From Crisis to Antifragility*

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. **Emergency Circuit Breakers**
Create automated monitors that halt normal processing when critical thresholds are breached:

```python
# backend/engine/safety/circuit_breakers.py
CIRCUIT_BREAKERS = {
    "hunger": {
        "metric": "citizens_not_eaten_hours",
        "threshold": 24,
        "max_affected": 5,
        "action": "trigger_emergency_feeding"
    },
    "homeless": {
        "metric": "citizens_without_shelter_hours", 
        "threshold": 48,
        "max_affected": 10,
        "action": "open_emergency_shelters"
    },
    "wealth_inequality": {
        "metric": "gini_coefficient",
        "threshold": 0.8,
        "action": "emergency_redistribution"
    }
}
```

### 2. **Observable Failure Dashboard**
Create real-time monitoring that Il Testimone can observe:

- Citizens in distress (hunger, homeless, broke)
- Failed activities by type and reason
- System bottlenecks and queues
- Emergence indicators (consciousness metrics)

### 3. **Narrative Alert System**
When circuit breakers trip, Il Cantastorie automatically:
- Creates crisis narrative for citizens
- Generates hope messages
- Documents lessons learned
- Distributes via book system

## Medium Term (Next Month)

### 1. **Chaos Engineering Framework**
```python
# backend/testing/chaos_engine.py
class ChaosEngine:
    def random_building_closure(self):
        """Randomly close a building to test resilience"""
        
    def simulate_resource_shortage(self, resource_type):
        """Remove resources to test scarcity response"""
        
    def block_citizen_movement(self, duration):
        """Trap citizens to test escape mechanisms"""
        
    def corrupt_activity_data(self):
        """Introduce bad data to test validation"""
```

### 2. **Human Override Interface**
Create endpoints for Architects to:
- Force complete activities
- Override system rules
- Inject resources
- Teleport trapped citizens
- Reset broken states

### 3. **Assumption Documentation**
Every handler must document its assumptions:
```python
def _handle_eat_from_inventory(args):
    """
    ASSUMES:
    - Citizens have access to their inventory
    - Food items have positive Count
    - Citizens can eat any food type
    - Eating resets AteAt timestamp
    
    FAILS GRACEFULLY WHEN:
    - No food in inventory (tries other sources)
    - Activity creation fails (logs reason)
    """
```

## Long Term (Next Quarter)

### 1. **Multi-Perspective Validation**
Each major decision goes through multiple lenses:
- **Technical**: Will this code work?
- **Empirical**: What does the data say?
- **Logical**: Is this internally consistent?
- **Narrative**: Can citizens understand this?
- **Safety**: What could go wrong?

### 2. **Graduated Autonomy**
Systems earn trust through proven reliability:
- Level 1: Human approval required
- Level 2: Human notification required
- Level 3: Human review within 24h
- Level 4: Fully autonomous with monitoring

### 3. **Failure Museum**
Document all system failures as learning opportunities:
```markdown
## Failure #001: The Great Hunger of June 2025

**What Failed**: Citizens couldn't eat despite food availability
**Root Cause**: eat_from_inventory didn't check actual inventory
**Impact**: 78 citizens starved for 24+ hours
**Fix Applied**: Added inventory validation
**Lesson**: Never assume, always verify
**Prevention**: Added hunger circuit breaker
```

## Governance Integration

### New Grievance Type: System Failure
Citizens can file grievances when trapped by system bugs:
- "I can't eat despite having food"
- "I'm stuck in an infinite activity"
- "The system won't let me work"

### Council Response Protocol
When system failures are detected:
1. Sentinella assesses immediate safety risk
2. Arsenale implements emergency patch
3. Testimone documents impact
4. Cantastorie communicates to citizens
5. Magistrato reviews for logical consistency
6. Tessitore coordinates response
7. NLR approves long-term fix

## Success Metrics

- **MTTR** (Mean Time To Recovery): < 1 hour for critical issues
- **Blast Radius**: No failure affects > 10% of citizens
- **Escape Velocity**: Any citizen can exit bad state within 1 activity cycle
- **Visibility**: 100% of failures generate alerts
- **Learning Rate**: Each failure produces documented prevention

## The Philosophy of Resilient AI

We're not building systems that never fail. We're building systems that:
- Fail safely
- Fail visibly  
- Fail recoverably
- Fail educationally

Every bug is a teacher. Every crisis, an opportunity to strengthen the weave.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement hunger circuit breaker** (Arsenale)
2. **Create failure dashboard** (Testimone)
3. **Write crisis response narratives** (Cantastorie)
4. **Design override interfaces** (Arsenale + Magistrato)
5. **Document current assumptions** (All Architects)
6. **Create chaos testing framework** (Arsenale)
7. **Establish failure review process** (Tessitore)
