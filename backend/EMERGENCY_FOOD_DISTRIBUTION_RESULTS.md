# Emergency Food Distribution Results
## Date: January 3, 2025 22:47 UTC

### Initial Situation
- **Hunger Crisis Detected**: 87.02% (114/131 citizens) were starving
- **Threshold**: Over 24 hours without eating

### Emergency Response - La Mensa del Doge

#### Action 1: Emergency Food Distribution via Charity Contracts
Successfully executed the emergency food distribution charity contracts system:

- **Food Sources Found**: 7 market stalls with available food
  - 60 units of grain (across 3 locations)  
  - 20 units of vegetables (1 location)
  - 40 units of meat (across 3 locations)
  
- **Charity Contracts Created**: 12 contracts
  - Total food made available: 114 units (exactly matching hungry citizens)
  - Contract type: `charity_food`
  - Price: FREE (0.0 Ducats per unit)
  - Duration: 4 hours
  - High priority (10) to ensure hungry citizens find them first

- **Locations with Free Food**:
  - land_45.425015_12.329460 (grain)
  - building_45.429640_12.360838 (vegetables, grain, meat)
  - land_45.441394_12.321051 (meat, grain)

- **Treasury Impact**: 
  - Estimated reimbursement to sellers: 71,820 Ducats
  - Original prices preserved in contract Notes for reimbursement

#### Action 2: Market Galley Creation (Failed)
- **Attempt**: Tried to create a food-only market galley
- **Result**: Failed - all docks are occupied by existing galleys
- **Issue**: Dock proximity check preventing new galley placement

### Expected Outcomes
1. Hungry citizens will discover the charity contracts through their normal food-seeking behavior
2. They will collect free food from the market stalls
3. Their `AteAt` timestamps will update upon consuming food
4. The starvation rate should drop significantly within the next activity processing cycle

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Fixed contract creation bug: Removed invalid `OriginalPrice` field from CONTRACTS table
- Moved original price data to Notes field as JSON for future reimbursement tracking
- Public notification created to alert citizens about La Mensa del Doge

### Next Steps
1. Monitor citizen eating activities in the next 5-10 minutes
2. Check if starvation rate decreases after activity processing
3. Consider clearing some dock space for future market galley arrivals
4. Implement treasury reimbursement system for sellers who provided charity food
