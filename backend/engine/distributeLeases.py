"""
Lease Distribution Script for La Serenissima.

This script:
1. For each land, finds all buildings on that land
2. For each building, transfers the LeasePrice from the building owner to the land owner
3. Creates notifications for both land owners and building owners
4. Generates an admin summary with statistics including top gainers and losers

Run this script daily to process lease payments between building owners and land owners.
