"""
Citizen Work Mobility script for La Serenissima.

This script:
1. Checks all employed citizens
2. Based on social class, determines if they look for better-paying jobs:
   - Nobili: 5% chance
   - Cittadini: 10% chance
   - Popolani: 15% chance
   - Facchini: 20% chance
3. If they decide to look, finds available businesses with wages above a threshold:
   - Nobili: 15% higher
   - Cittadini: 12% higher
   - Popolani: 10% higher
   - Facchini: 8% higher
4. Moves citizens to better-paying jobs if found
5. Sends notifications to relevant parties

Run this script daily to simulate job mobility in Venice.
