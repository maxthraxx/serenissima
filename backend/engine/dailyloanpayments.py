"""
Daily Loan Payments script for La Serenissima.

This script:
1. Fetches all active loans from the LOANS table
2. For each active loan:
   - Deducts the payment amount from the borrower's compute balance
   - Adds the payment amount to the lender's compute balance
   - Updates the loan's remaining balance
   - Marks the loan as "paid" if the remaining balance reaches zero
3. Creates transaction records for each payment
4. Creates notifications for borrowers and lenders

Run this script daily to process loan payments.
