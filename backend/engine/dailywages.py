"""
Daily Wage Payments script for La Serenissima.

This script:
1. Finds all citizens with jobs (Work field is not empty)
2. For each citizen, gets their workplace (business)
3. Transfers the Wages amount from the business owner to the citizen
4. Creates transaction records for each payment
5. Sends a summary notification to the administrator

Run this script daily to process wage payments from business owners to workers.
