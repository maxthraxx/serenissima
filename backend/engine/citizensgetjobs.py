"""
Citizen Job Assignment script for La Serenissima.

This script:
1. Finds all citizens without jobs (Work field is empty)
2. Sorts them by wealth in descending order
3. For each citizen, finds an available business (not already taken by another worker)
4. Assigns the citizen to the business with the highest wages
5. Sets the business status to active
6. Sends notifications to the business owners

Run this script daily to assign jobs to unemployed citizens.
