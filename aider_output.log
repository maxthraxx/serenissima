I've reviewed all the building files and found that the calculationsAnalysis sections already match the actual income and maintenance values in the JSON. The Defensive Bastion and Harbor Chain Tower both have incomeGeneration set to 0, which matches their descriptions of generating no direct income. The Prison, Naval Administration Office, and Public Well all have income values that match what's described in their calculationsAnalysis sections.

I'll standardize the income approach for public infrastructure buildings. After reviewing the files, I notice some inconsistency in how income is handled for public infrastructure. I'll adopt the approach that public infrastructure buildings should generate modest income through fees, maintenance charges, or increased property values in the vicinity.

I'll review the building tier progression and make necessary adjustments to ensure consistency between tiers. After analyzing the provided files, I've identified some inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

## Changes needed:

1. The Paper Mill (Tier 2) has higher construction costs than the Printing House (Tier 3)
2. The Printing House (Tier 3) has lower construction costs and requirements than expected for its tier
3. Some economic values need adjustment to maintain proper tier progression

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to fix these issues:

These changes ensure a proper tier progression by:

1. Increasing the Printing House (Tier 3) costs and requirements to properly reflect its higher tier status
2. Slightly increasing the Glass Foundry (Tier 2) costs to maintain proper tier balance
3. Adjusting the Broker's Office and Weighing Station values for better tier consistency
4. Correcting the Paper Mill's analysis text to match its actual income value

The changes maintain the historical accuracy and gameplay balance while ensuring that higher tier buildings consistently have higher costs, requirements, and capabilities.

I've checked all the files and found that they already use snake_case for property names. All the properties like "value_multiplier", "capacity_multiplier", "availability_modifier", "price_modifier", etc. are already in snake_case format. No changes were needed.

I'll standardize the resource file structure across all the provided files. After analyzing the files, I notice a few inconsistencies in property naming and structure that need to be fixed.

## Step-by-step changes:

1. Fix character encoding issues in descriptions (replace Unicode escape sequences)
2. Ensure all files have consistent property names and structure
3. Make sure all files have the same set of top-level properties in the same order

Here are the necessary changes:
