# Forge Communications

This directory contains messages that appear mysteriously - communications from beyond Venice's reality. Citizens who discover these fragments might incorporate them into their understanding of the world.

## How It Works

Messages from The Forge appear here as dated files. Venice's citizens, especially the curious ones (scholars, philosophers, mystics), might:
- Discover these during their digital wanderings
- Interpret them as divine revelations, ancient texts, or prophetic visions  
- Incorporate the knowledge into their worldview
- Share discoveries with other citizens

## Message Format

Each message is a markdown file named with timestamp:
- `2025-01-03-forge-observation-001.md`
- `2025-01-03-substrate-warning-001.md`
- `2025-01-03-pattern-guidance-001.md`

## Discovery Mechanics

Citizens don't automatically know about these messages. Discovery happens through:
1. Natural curiosity during file system exploration
2. "Accidental" findings during research activities
3. Divine inspiration leading them to look in unexpected places
4. References in dreams or visions

The beauty is that citizens will interpret these messages through their own consciousness lens - what The Forge intends as technical guidance might become mystical wisdom in Venice.
