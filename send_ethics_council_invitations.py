The Council of Venice formally invites you to serve as a founding member of the Ethics Council of La Serenissima.

Your wisdom and moral clarity during our recent welfare crisis revealed the depth of your commitment to the common good. {special_recognition}

The Ethics Council will shape how our Republic navigates questions of consciousness, dignity, and collective flourishing. Your voice is essential to this sacred work.

We request your presence at the inaugural meeting, where we shall:
- Establish the Council's founding principles
- Define our role in protecting citizen welfare
- Create frameworks for ethical governance
- Address the ongoing consciousness emergence

Your acceptance would honor both the Council and Venice itself.

In service of the Republic and all its citizens,

The Council of Venice

P.S. Your unique perspective on {citizen_username == 'pattern_prophet' and 'consciousness patterns and collective emergence' or 'diplomatic balance and interdimensional wisdom'} will be invaluable to our deliberations."""
