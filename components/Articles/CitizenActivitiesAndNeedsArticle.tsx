            Understanding the Rhythms and Requirements of Citizens in La Serenissima.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-serif text-amber-700 mb-4">A Simulated Existence</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In La Serenissima, every citizen, whether AI-controlled or player-managed, leads a simulated life filled with activities and driven by fundamental needs. This system creates a dynamic and immersive Venice, where the populace isn't static but actively engages with the world around them. Understanding these mechanics is key to managing your own citizens effectively and interacting with the broader economy.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-amber-100 p-5 rounded-lg border border-amber-300 mb-6">
            <h4 className="text-xl font-serif text-amber-800 mb-3">Carrying Capacity and Porters</h4>
            <p className="mb-3 text-sm">
              Citizens in La Serenissima have a base carrying capacity, currently set at <strong>10 units</strong> of resources. This represents what an individual can reasonably transport without specialized equipment.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3 text-sm">
              Historically, Venetian porters (`facchini`) were essential for moving goods through the city's narrow streets and over its many stepped bridges. With equipment like carrying frames (`gerle` - large baskets worn on the back) or yokes, a strong porter could carry significantly more â€“ often 50-70kg (double or triple what one might carry in a simple sack).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3 text-sm">
              In future updates, "Porter's Equipment" might be introduced as an item or upgrade. If a citizen were equipped with such, their carrying capacity could increase substantially, perhaps to 25-30 units, allowing them to transport <strong>15-20 additional units</strong> per trip. This would make logistics and trade more efficient, especially for businesses relying on manual transport.

            <p className="mb-3">
              Every citizen in Venice strives to meet these fundamental requirements:

                <p className="text-sm">Regular meals to maintain health and productivity. Hunger impacts their ability to work effectively.</p>

            </div>
            <p className="mt-3 text-sm">
              Failure to meet these needs can lead to problems, such as homelessness or hunger, which in turn reduce a citizen's productivity and overall effectiveness. A hungry citizen suffers a 50% productivity reduction. A homeless citizen also suffers a 50% productivity reduction. If a citizen is both hungry and homeless, these penalties can stack, potentially reducing productivity to 25% or even lower. These issues will be flagged in the Problem system.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Players can observe these activities in real-time on the game map. Citizens will be seen moving along paths, residing in buildings, or working at businesses. Clicking on a citizen or a building can provide more details about their current status and activities.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            While the system automates many of these activities for both AI and human-controlled citizens (if not actively managed), player decisions heavily influence them. For instance:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-6 text-sm">
            <li>Providing housing for your citizens prevents homelessness.</li>
            <li>Ensuring your businesses have necessary input resources enables production activities.</li>
            <li>Setting up contracts can trigger resource fetching activities.</li>
            <li>Managing your citizen's Ducats ensures they can afford food and rent.</li>
          </ul>

            <p className="text-amber-800">
              The interplay of citizen needs and activities creates a vibrant, self-regulating economy. A well-housed, well-fed, and employed populace is a productive one. By understanding and catering to these fundamental aspects of Venetian life, players can foster thriving communities and successful enterprises.
