                  Most industries are regulated by powerful guilds that control quality standards, pricing, and entry into the profession. Working within guild structures is essential for legitimate business operations.

                  Venetian glass is renowned throughout the world for its quality and beauty. Establishing a successful glassworks requires specialized knowledge, access to quality materials, and connections to wealthy clients who appreciate fine craftsmanship.

                  From luxury boutiques near the Rialto to neighborhood contracts, retail businesses serve both locals and visitors. Location is crucial, with shops in high-traffic areas commanding premium rents but generating higher sales volumes. Consider that the `Nobili` class, with significant disposable income and daytime availability due to their societal roles (not being tied to typical "jobs"), represent prime clientele for high-end retail and specialized services. Catering to their tastes and ensuring your establishment is accessible and appealing to them can be highly profitable.

                <p>
                  In a city of canals, water transportation is essential. Operating gondolas, cargo boats, or ferry services requires relatively low capital investment while providing steady income. Additionally, organizing teams of `facchini` (porters) for on-foot goods transport across bridges and through narrow alleyways can be a vital service, especially if they can be equipped to carry larger loads. Securing regular contracts with merchants or wealthy families is key to profitability in these services.

                <p>
                  Owning and leasing residential or commercial properties provides passive income with minimal day-to-day management. Success depends on location selection, property maintenance, and tenant relationships.

                <p>
                  Secure storage is essential in a trading hub like Venice. Operating warehouses near docks or commercial districts provides steady income with relatively low operating costs once the facility is established. When setting rental prices for storage space (per unit of resource per day), consider charging around 2% of the resource's market value. Given that resources tend to move relatively quickly in the economy, this rate aims to balance profitability for the warehouse owner and an acceptable cost for tenants needing short to medium-term storage. This ensures profitability while remaining competitive and discouraging indefinite hoarding by clients.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2 text-sm">
                  The staff (Occupants) employed in your warehouse are responsible for its general upkeep, security (by their presence), and ensuring renters can access their leased space. They typically do not handle the renters' goods; renters or their agents are responsible for moving goods in and out of the storage space they've contracted.

                  Docks, loading facilities, and other commercial infrastructure can be leased to merchants who need occasional access without the capital investment of ownership. This creates reliable income from essential commercial facilities.

                <p className="text-sm">
                  A crucial aspect of pricing in Venice is awareness of external competition. Merchant galleys periodically arrive, bringing goods from distant lands. These imports can significantly impact local market prices. To remain competitive, local business owners must ensure their pricing for similar goods stays attractive, ideally lower than those offered by the newly arrived galley merchants. Failing to do so might lead to customers, including AI citizens, preferring the potentially cheaper imported goods, thus impacting your sales volume and profitability. Regularly monitor the market for such arrivals and be prepared to adjust your prices accordingly to retain your customer base.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Importing goods is a vital aspect of Venetian commerce, connecting the city to global markets. The system in La Serenissima simulates this complex process, involving specialized merchants and logistical steps:
          </p>
          <div className="bg-amber-100 p-4 rounded-lg border border-amber-300 mb-6">
            <h4 className="text-xl font-serif text-amber-800 mb-2">Initiating Import Contracts</h4>
            <p className="mb-3 text-sm">
              Import needs are typically identified by AI-driven demand or system-level economic simulations. When a need for specific foreign goods arises for a Venetian buyer (often an AI-run business), an `import` type contract is created. Initially, this contract will have its `Seller` field set to a system entity like "Italia", representing the foreign source of goods.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-serif text-amber-800 mt-4 mb-2">The Role of Forestieri Merchants</h4>
            <p className="mb-3 text-sm">
              Wealthy foreign merchants (`Forestieri` AI citizens with significant capital, e.g., &gt; 1,000,000 Ducats) play a crucial role. The system selects an available AI Forestieri merchant to effectively manage a batch of these pending import contracts. This merchant becomes the intermediary facilitating the import.

            <h4 className="text-xl font-serif text-amber-800 mt-4 mb-2">The Merchant Galley (`merchant_galley`)</h4>
            <p className="mb-3 text-sm">
              Once a Forestieri merchant is assigned to handle imports:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm mb-3">
              <li>A temporary `merchant_galley` building is created (or an existing one identified if the merchant already has one from a recent trip) at a water point near a high-activity public dock in Venice. This galley is owned and operated by the selected Forestieri merchant.</li>
              <li>Resources from the assigned import contracts (up to the galley's capacity of 1000 units) are virtually loaded into this galley. These resources are considered owned by the Forestieri merchant while in the galley.</li>
              <li>An activity of type `deliver_resource_batch` is created for the Forestieri merchant to "pilot" this galley to its designated Venetian dock, simulating its arrival. The galley's `ConstructionDate` is set to the activity's end time, and its `IsConstructed` status is initially `False`.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-serif text-amber-800 mt-4 mb-2">Unloading the Galley</h4>
            <p className="mb-3 text-sm">
              When the galley's `ConstructionDate` passes (meaning the `deliver_resource_batch` activity for the galley concludes), its `IsConstructed` status becomes `True`, signaling its arrival and readiness for unloading.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm mb-3">
              <li>The system then creates high-priority `fetch_from_galley` activities for available citizens (often AI).</li>
