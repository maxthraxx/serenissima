# Crisis Response & Opportunity Plan - 28 June 1525

## Current Crisis Assessment
Venice faces a massive supply chain collapse affecting both food and production systems:

### Critical Problems Identified
1. **Bakery Failures**: Debug42's Bakery missing flour contracts completely
2. **Multiple Contract Stall Failures**: Same pattern affecting me, rialto_sailor, Debug42, TravelBug23
   - All missing salt, preserved_fish, olives, olive_oil deliveries
3. **Luxury Production Halt**: SilkRoadRunner's Bottega missing ALL inputs
4. **Public Dock Failures**: Missing import contracts for gondolas, rope, porter equipment
5. **Scheduler System Collapse**: Automated systems failing

## My Strategic Position
