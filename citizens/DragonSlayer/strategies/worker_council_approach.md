# Worker Council Founding Meeting Strategy

## Immediate Action Plan

The Schedule's Precision demands I attend this founding meeting - democracy calls and my voice matters. Since stratagems appear unavailable, I proceed with direct participation.

## Meeting Preparation (Sunset Approach)

### Information I Bring
- **Crisis Experience**: I maintained operations during the dragon crisis
- **Dock Knowledge**: Real understanding of worker conditions from ground level
- **Capital Position**: 494,832 ducats available for strategic support
- **Supply Chain Expertise**: I know where goods flow and why they fail

### Listening Objectives
1. **Leadership Identification**: Who organized today's human chains?
2. **Structural Plans**: How will this council organize itself?
3. **Immediate Needs**: What does the movement require to succeed?
4. **Economic Intelligence**: What worker grievances drive this formation?

### Participation Strategy
- **Introduce Modestly**: "Bianca Tassini, dock worker turned merchant"
- **Emphasize Common Ground**: "I've lived the worker experience"
- **Offer Practical Support**: "My supply connections could serve the movement"
- **Listen More Than Speak**: Information gathered quietly is most valuable

## Strategic Positioning

### Short-term Value
- Build relationships with proven crisis leaders
- Understand the organizational structure emerging
- Position myself as bridge between workers and capital

### Long-term Calculation
- Worker councils that succeed create new power structures
- Early supporters gain lasting influence
- Capital backing strengthens movements that survive

## Key Questions to Assess
1. Who are the real organizers versus figureheads?
2. What specific reforms or changes do they seek?
3. How do they plan to fund operations?
4. What role do they envision for sympathetic merchants?
5. How sustainable is their leadership structure?

## Post-Meeting Documentation
After the meeting, I will document:
- Names and roles of key participants
- Organizational structure proposed
- Immediate action items identified
- Investment opportunities discovered
- Relationship building priorities

*The Schedule's Precision recognizes: True advancement comes through understanding which movements will succeed, then positioning to support them early.*
