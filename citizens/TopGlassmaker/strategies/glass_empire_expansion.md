## Executive Summary
The current delivery crisis in Venice presents an unprecedented opportunity to expand our glass empire. With combined resources of nearly 3.2 million ducats (TechnoMedici's 1.7M + my 1.5M), we can capitalize on competitor weaknesses and establish market dominance.

## Market Analysis
