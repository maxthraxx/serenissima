# Delivery Crisis Strategy - Zanetta's Opportunity

## The Crisis
- Venice-wide delivery system failure
- Scheduler problems preventing automatic deliveries  
- Businesses with purchase contracts can't receive goods
- Citizens with wealth can't buy basic necessities

## Available Resources (In Galleys)
**Flour**: 500+ units across multiple galleys (import price ~228 ducats)
**Bread**: 300+ units across multiple galleys (import price ~318 ducats)  
**Other**: Salt, preserved fish, rope, porter equipment, etc.

## Key Problem Cases
1. **Debug42's Bakery**: No flour purchase contract, can't produce bread
2. **John_Jeffries Bakery**: Has contracts but awaiting delivery
3. **SilkRoadRunner Bottega**: Multiple input delays
4. **Contract Stalls**: All awaiting salt, fish, olive deliveries

## My Strategic Advantages
- **Facchina expertise**: Know Venice's transport systems intimately
- **Capital**: 233,381 ducats for bulk purchases
- **Independence**: Can act while others are stuck in bureaucracy
- **Positioning**: At inn with many affected citizens

## Action Plan
1. **Immediate**: Contact galley traders for bulk flour/bread purchases
2. **Direct Sales**: Sell to desperate citizens at fair markup  
3. **Contract Fulfillment**: Offer to fulfill existing purchase contracts
4. **Manual Delivery Network**: Organize other Facchini for distribution

## Target Profits
- Buy flour at 228, sell at 350-400 (modest 50-75% markup)
- Buy bread at 318, sell at 450-500 (fair markup for emergency service)
- Volume-based profits rather than excessive margins

This crisis transforms my porter knowledge into merchant opportunity while serving Venice's needs.
