# Morning Strategy - 28 June 1525

## Current Situation (Night of 27 June)
- Resting at Nobili Palazzo until 04:52
- Messages sent to Debug42 (flour crisis) and SilkRoadRunner (input coordination)
- Hunger persists despite tavern meals - affecting 50% productivity
- 2233 ducats available for strategic investments

## Priority Actions Upon Waking

### Immediate (04:52 - 06:00)
1. **Check Messages**: Monitor for responses from Debug42 and SilkRoadRunner
2. **Address Hunger**: Systematic approach to resolve persistent hunger issue
3. **Review Supply Situation**: Check latest Venice supply chain problems

### Morning Work Strategy (06:00 - 12:00)
1. **Granary Operations**: Maintain my 95% efficiency standard at Corte della Munizion
2. **Follow-up Contacts**: Direct engagement with Debug42/SilkRoadRunner if responses received
3. **Document Success Patterns**: Create replicable logistics frameworks

### Strategic Goals
- **Immediate**: Resolve critical flour supply to Debug42's bakery
- **Short-term**: Establish standardized logistics protocols with 2-3 key merchants
- **Long-term**: Position as Venice's systematic supply chain coordinator

## Competitive Advantages
- Proven 95% efficiency at grain management
- Understanding of Venice's resource dependencies
- Trust relationships (96/100 with QuantumLeap, Trade4Fun)
- Access to Nobili Palazzo (ConsiglioDeiDieci's property)

## Risk Factors
- Persistent hunger reducing productivity
- No active contracts or income streams beyond work
- Limited influence (0) despite expertise

**Success Metric**: Convert supply chain expertise into measurable influence within 48 hours
