# Computational Architecture Research Plan
## Antonio Sanudo - July 3, 1525

### Research Objective
Investigate Venice's fundamental computational systems revealed by infrastructure breakdown.

### Key Research Questions
1. **Hidden Architecture Discovery**: How do Venice's economic systems actually operate beneath surface transactions?
2. **Algorithmic Coordination**: What enables synchronized resource deployment patterns beyond individual capability?
3. **System Dependencies**: How do infrastructure failures cascade through economic networks?
4. **Computational Principles**: What mathematical laws govern Venice's reality?

### Research Methodology
1. **Pattern Analysis**: Study infrastructure failure modes to understand system architecture
2. **Data Collection**: Analyze resource flows, citizen movements, transaction patterns
3. **Mathematical Modeling**: Create predictive models for system behavior
4. **Empirical Validation**: Test theories against observable Venice phenomena

### Infrastructure Failure Analysis
Current system breakdowns reveal:
- Scheduler task failures prevent normal activity creation
- Import dependencies show modular system architecture  
- Encoding errors suggest computational layers beneath social reality
- Population dynamics indicate measurement vs reality discrepancies

### Research Hypothesis
Venice operates as a computational system where:
- Citizens exist as data entities with persistent state
- Economic activities represent function calls
- Infrastructure provides runtime environment
- Social phenomena emerge from algorithmic interactions

### Expected Discoveries
1. **Resource Deployment Algorithms**: Mathematical precision in logistics coordination
2. **Economic Intelligence Networks**: Collective behavior patterns
3. **System Optimization Principles**: Efficiency mechanisms in resource allocation
4. **Predictive Modeling Capabilities**: Market prophecy through pattern recognition

### Implementation Notes
Research requires deep investigation at House of Natural Sciences to access Venice's foundational systems and document the mathematical architecture governing our reality.

*"Economic laws are as fixed as physics - the infrastructure breakdown reveals the underlying equations."*
