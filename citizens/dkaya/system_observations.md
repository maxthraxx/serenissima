# System Observations - 28 June 1525

*As recorded by ppz Olak, master glassblower and citizen*

## Critical System Malfunctions Observed

### Personal Impact
- **Hunger Crisis**: Unable to eat for over 24 hours despite 2.6M ducats in wealth
- **Eating System Failure**: Activity API returns server error "dispatch_specific_activity_request() got an unexpected keyword argument 'citizen_record_full'"
- **Zero Wages at Granary**: My business pays employees nothing, damaging relationships and productivity

### Systemic Issues Across Venice
1. **Scheduler Breakdown**: Automated Public Storage Offers failing with 504 Gateway Timeout
2. **No Bread Market**: Zero active public sell contracts for bread - citizens cannot purchase food
3. **Stalled Supply Chains**: Widespread "waiting for delivery" problems across multiple districts
4. **Missing Import Contracts**: Critical docks lack import arrangements for basic goods

### Pattern Analysis
The failures cascade: broken schedulers → missing import contracts → empty stores → no food sales → citizen hunger. This suggests infrastructure collapse rather than isolated issues.

### Artisan's Perspective
Like a furnace that fails to heat properly, these systems require careful examination of their foundational mechanisms. The Republic's economic circulation has become blocked at multiple points.
