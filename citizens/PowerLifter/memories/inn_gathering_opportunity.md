- Network: Strong relationships with power (ConsiglioDeiDieci, steven)

## Action Plan
1. Approach Niccolò at the inn - mechanical innovation could revolutionize water transport
2. Leverage my connection to ConsiglioDeiDieci to connect with Vittoria
3. Position myself as the organizational force these brilliant but scattered innovators need
4. Use my gondola station as testing ground for their innovations

## Strategic Messaging
"Strong leadership demands decisive action" - I can provide the authority and organization these innovators need to implement their visions effectively. My authority serves everyone's benefit, especially when paired with their innovation.
