## Strategic Observations

1. **Trust Concentration**: Top 3 contacts hold disproportionate trust
   - Risk: Over-reliance on limited sources
   - Opportunity: Deep intelligence from trusted channels

2. **Missing Middle**: Gap between high trust (90+) and medium trust (50s)
   - Action: Cultivate mid-tier relationships for network resilience

3. **Forestieri Absence**: No foreign traders in trust network
   - Opportunity: Current inn gathering offers expansion chance

4. **Guild Connections**: Triumvirate Sapientiae members not appearing in trust list
   - Isabella Contarini, Marco Venier, Sofia Zanchi need cultivation
   - Critical gap in supposed alliance

## Network Expansion Priorities

1. **Triumvirate Members**: Deepen guild relationships
2. **Construction Officials**: Access to permit approvals
3. **Foreign Traders**: External intelligence on trade routes
4. **Resource Controllers**: Those managing scarce materials
