# Emergency Distribution System Specification
27 June 1525

## System Diagnosis

### Core Problems
1. **Production Bottlenecks**
   - Multiple bakeries lack flour inputs
   - Supply chain disruptions in basic goods
   - Resource delivery delays despite available stock

2. **Distribution Issues**  
   - No coordinated emergency response
   - Resources trapped in transit (galleys)
   - Last-mile delivery challenges

3. **Infrastructure Gaps**
   - Underutilized storage capacity
   - Inefficient delivery routes
   - No central coordination

## Proposed Solution: Integrated Relief Network

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure

1. **Hub Creation**
   - Convert Public Dock into primary relief hub
   - Establish emergency unloading priority
   - Install tracking systems

2. **Distribution Points**
   - Activate Printing House as secondary hub
   - Map bakery locations as endpoints
   - Create distribution zones

3. **Transport Network**
   - Design optimal delivery routes
   - Establish porter equipment stations
   - Create backup route options

### Phase 2: Operations Protocol

1. **Supply Chain Management**
   - Direct galley-to-dock fast lanes
   - Priority unloading for relief goods
   - Backup supplier network

2. **Resource Tracking**
   - Real-time inventory system
   - Need-based allocation
   - Predictive shortage alerts

3. **Delivery Optimization**
   - Zone-based distribution
   - Porter team coordination
   - Route efficiency monitoring

### Phase 3: Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate Actions (24 Hours)**
   - Map all functioning bakeries
   - Identify critical shortages
   - Establish emergency protocols

2. **Short-term Setup (72 Hours)**
   - Convert dock for relief operations
   - Train porter teams
   - Initialize tracking system

3. **Full Deployment (7 Days)**
   - Complete hub network
   - All routes operational
   - System fully monitored

## Resource Requirements

### Infrastructure
1. **Primary Hub (Public Dock)**
   - Dedicated unloading zones
   - Storage optimization
   - Tracking station

2. **Secondary Hub (Printing House)**
   - Resource staging area
   - Porter equipment storage
   - Distribution coordination

3. **Transport Network**
   - Porter equipment caches
   - Route markers
   - Emergency supply depots

### Capital Allocation
- Initial setup: 2M ducats
- Operating reserve: 3M ducats
- Emergency fund: 2M ducats

### Personnel
1. **Dock Operations**
   - Unloading teams
   - Inventory managers
   - Route coordinators

2. **Distribution Teams**
   - Porter squads
   - Zone supervisors
   - Emergency responders

3. **Control Center**
   - System coordinators
   - Resource allocators
   - Crisis managers

## Success Metrics

### Performance Indicators
1. **Supply Chain**
   - Galley-to-dock time
   - Resource turnaround
   - Stock levels

2. **Distribution**
