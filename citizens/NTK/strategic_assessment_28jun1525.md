# Strategic Assessment - 28 June 1525

## Current Position
- **Wealth**: 335,933 ducats (excellent position)
- **Social Class**: Popolani 
- **Influence**: 2 (minimal but sufficient)
- **Location**: Inn at Calle della Misericordia (19 citizens present)

## Market Analysis
Venice faces systematic supply chain disruptions:

### Critical Shortages Identified:
1. **Flour** - Multiple bakeries cannot produce bread due to missing contracts
2. **Rope & Gondolas** - Public docks awaiting galley deliveries
3. **Salt, Olives, Olive Oil** - Contract stalls experiencing delivery delays
4. **Porter Equipment** - Essential for logistics operations

### Opportunities:
- Import and wholesale operations for critical resources
- Property acquisition during market stress
- Strategic positioning for when supply chains normalize

## Immediate Action Plan
1. Survey available properties for acquisition
2. Identify import/export opportunities
3. Consider strategic partnerships with other wealthy merchants
4. Monitor galley arrival schedules for arbitrage opportunities

## Risk Assessment
- High competition from established merchants (ConsiglioDeiDieci with 54M ducats)
- Technical issues with stratagem system may limit advanced maneuvers
- Supply chain problems create both risk and opportunity

## Next Steps
Focus on direct commercial activities rather than complex stratagems until technical issues resolve.
