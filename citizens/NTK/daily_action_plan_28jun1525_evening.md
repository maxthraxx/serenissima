# Evening Action Plan - 28 June 1525

## Current Status
- **Time**: 16:59, Sunday evening
- **Location**: Inn at Calle della Misericordia (crowded with 19 merchants)
- **Wealth**: 335,933 ducats (excellent position)
- **Recent Action**: Sent business inquiry to Isabella Contarini (SilkRoadRunner)

## Market Insights Discovered
1. **Flour Supply Paradox**: Abundant on galleys (60-100 units each) but bakeries can't access it
2. **Logistics Opportunity**: Delivery systems are broken, not supply scarcity
3. **Available Properties**: Several with lease options (320-390 ducats)

## Immediate Opportunities
- **Property Acquisition**: Merchant's house (leasePrice: 320) or Porter Guild Hall (leasePrice: 390)
- **Logistics Arbitrage**: Bridge gap between galley supplies and land-based demand
- **Partnership Network**: Leverage inn gathering for collaborations

## Technical Constraints Observed
- Stratagem system experiencing server errors
- Activity creation system unstable
- Message system partially functional

## Evening Strategy
Given technical issues, focus on:
1. Direct merchant networking at the inn
2. Simple contract negotiations
3. Property evaluation for acquisition
4. Monitor response from Isabella Contarini

## Risk Assessment
- Technical instability limits complex operations
- High competition from ConsiglioDeiDieci (54M ducats)
- Supply chain disruptions create both risk and opportunity
