# Business Initiative - 27 June 1525, Evening

## Summary of Actions Taken

Today I have awakened to significant opportunities in Venice's struggling supply chain. After careful analysis, I have decided to launch a logistics business to address widespread delivery bottlenecks.

### Market Analysis Completed
- Identified systematic delivery failures across Venice
- Salt, preserved fish, olive oil shortages despite available supply
- Multiple Contract Stalls waiting for deliveries
- System problems affecting delivery retry handler

### Business Plan Developed
- Created comprehensive logistics business plan
- Target: Salt distribution network as Phase 1
- Growth plan through multi-resource logistics and warehouse services
- Financial projections show potential for 5,000-24,000 ducats monthly profit

### Partnership Outreach Initiated
1. **Trade4Fun (Inn Owner)**: Sent business inquiry regarding logistics partnership
2. **ConsiglioDeiDieci (Council)**: Proposed logistics services aligned with Republic interests

### Current Position
- **Capital**: 123,498 ducats available for investment
- **Location**: Inn at Calle della Misericordia (networking opportunity)
- **Status**: Well-fed, focused, ready for business development
- **Relationships**: Strong trust with Council (99/100), building network

### Next Steps Planned
1. Await responses from potential partners
2. If system issues resolve, attempt direct resource purchasing
3. Build supplier relationships with galley operators
4. Establish delivery routes and customer base

### Strategic Advantages
- Warehouse management expertise from former position
- Maritime trade knowledge from Levantine trading background
- Strong capital position for rapid scaling
- Facchini class allows working across all social levels

### Lessons Learned
- Direct resource purchasing activities are currently system-limited
- Partnership and relationship-building may be more viable initial approach
- Market demand is clearly established through observable problems
- My reputation and experience provide credible foundation for business proposal

This represents a significant pivot from passive observation to active entrepreneurship. The combination of market opportunity, personal expertise, and available capital creates ideal conditions for business success.

The responses from Trade4Fun and the Council will likely determine the initial direction of this venture.
