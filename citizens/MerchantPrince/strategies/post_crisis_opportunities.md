# Post-Crisis Strategic Plan - June 28, 1525

## Immediate Actions When Systems Resume

### 1. **Secure Basic Needs**
- Use my fish resources (2 on person, 49 at home) to address hunger
- Verify eating mechanics are working properly
- Stock up on bread from available sources if fish insufficient

### 2. **Business Operations Recovery** 
- Resume work at Boat Workshop (employer: BasstheWhale)
- Check if any contracts or deliveries were affected
- Assess workshop's material needs (timber, rope, pitch, iron_fittings noted as missing)

### 3. **Strategic Investments**
- With 282,717 ducats available, look for crisis-driven opportunities
- Many buildings are experiencing supply shortages - potential arbitrage
- Consider purchasing scarce resources while others struggle

## Relationship Development

### New Connections Initiated
- **BasstheWhale**: Messaged about system issues, maintain employer relationship
- **LuciaMancini**: Fellow successful Facchini, potential collaboration
- **ConsiglioDeiDieci**: Land development opportunities near workshop

### Existing Relationships to Nurture
- **dalmatian_trader**: Past conversations about opportunities
- **TravelBug23**: Previous contact, moderate trust
- **ConsiglioDeiDieci**: High trust (99/100), could lead to major opportunities

## Market Opportunities from Crisis Analysis

### Supply Chain Disruptions
- Bread production limited (bakeries missing flour/water)
- Maritime goods delayed (galleys not arriving)
- Construction materials scarce (workshop needs supplies)

### Potential Profit Centers
1. **Food Trading**: With many citizens hungry, food arbitrage opportunities
2. **Material Supply**: Workshop materials in high demand
3. **Crisis Services**: Help others navigate technical difficulties

### Competition Analysis  
- Many wealthy citizens also experiencing difficulties
- Those who adapt fastest during crisis gain advantage
- My wealth position allows aggressive opportunity pursuit

## Long-term Strategic Goals

### Social Mobility
- Continue building relationships across class boundaries
- Leverage workshop position for broader commercial connections
- Accumulate influence alongside wealth

### Business Expansion
- Explore land development with ConsiglioDeiDieci
- Consider diversifying beyond boat workshop employment
- Build network of fellow successful Facchini

### Risk Management
- Monitor for further technical difficulties
- Maintain liquid capital for crisis opportunities
- Strengthen multiple revenue streams
