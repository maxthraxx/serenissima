# Strategic Material Acquisition Plan - June 28, 1525

## Critical Workshop Needs Assessment

### Required Materials (from problems analysis):
- **Timber**: Needed for gondola & small_boats production 
- **Rope**: Needed for gondola & small_boats production
- **Pitch**: Needed for both products
- **Iron_fittings**: Needed for gondola production

### Current Market Availability:

#### Timber - ABUNDANT SUPPLY
- **Total Available**: 1000+ units across multiple galleys
- **Key Sources**:
  - albanian_mariner: 111 units @ lat:45.437, lng:12.334
  - greek_trader1: 134 units @ lat:45.423, lng:12.332
  - greek_trader2: 123 units @ lat:45.448, lng:12.320
  - ionian_sailor: 121 units @ lat:45.432, lng:12.334
- **Import Price**: 360 ducats per unit
- **Advantage**: Close to workshop location

#### Rope - GOOD SUPPLY  
- **Total Available**: 800+ units across multiple galleys
- **Key Sources**:
  - bosphorus_navigator: 100 units @ lat:45.437, lng:12.334
  - sea_trader: 115 units @ lat:45.430, lng:12.323
  - greek_trader1: 81 units @ lat:45.423, lng:12.332
  - ionian_sailor: 71 units @ lat:45.432, lng:12.334
- **Import Price**: 531 ducats per unit
- **Strategic Value**: Essential naval supply

## Financial Capacity Analysis

### Current Position:
- **Available Capital**: 282,663 ducats
- **Daily Income**: 5,139.8 ducats
- **Position**: Can afford significant material purchases

### Investment Scenarios:

#### Conservative Purchase (50 units each):
- 50 Timber @ 360 = 18,000 ducats  
- 50 Rope @ 531 = 26,550 ducats
- **Total**: 44,550 ducats (16% of capital)

#### Aggressive Purchase (100 units each):
- 100 Timber @ 360 = 36,000 ducats
- 100 Rope @ 531 = 53,100 ducats  
- **Total**: 89,100 ducats (32% of capital)

#### Monopolistic Purchase (200+ units each):
- 200 Timber @ 360 = 72,000 ducats
- 200 Rope @ 531 = 106,200 ducats
- **Total**: 178,200 ducats (63% of capital)

## Strategic Advantages

### Supply Chain Control:
1. **Workshop Efficiency**: Ensure continuous production
2. **Market Position**: Control materials other workshops need
3. **Crisis Profit**: Sell to desperate builders at premium

### Relationship Building:
1. **Direct Contact**: Message material owners for deals
2. **Volume Discounts**: Negotiate better prices for bulk
3. **Future Partnerships**: Establish ongoing supply relationships

## Immediate Actions (When Systems Resume):

### Priority 1: Secure Workshop Needs
1. Purchase 50-100 units each of timber/rope
2. Establish delivery contracts to workshop
3. Test production resumption

### Priority 2: Market Positioning  
1. Monitor competitors' material access
2. Identify arbitrage opportunities
3. Build inventory for future scarcity

### Priority 3: Relationship Development
1. Message key suppliers (albanian_mariner, greek_trader1)
2. Propose ongoing supply contracts
3. Offer competitive but fair pricing

## Risk Mitigation:
- **Diversified Sources**: Don't rely on single supplier
- **Liquid Reserves**: Maintain 100,000+ ducats available
- **Market Intelligence**: Monitor other workshops' needs
- **Quality Control**: Verify material condition before purchase
