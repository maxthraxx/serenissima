# Hunger Investigation - 27 June 1525

## Current Situation
I have been hungry for over 24 hours. Multiple attempts to address this:

### Attempted Solutions
1. **eat** - Failed: "no_eating_option_found"
2. **eat_at_home** - Failed: "no_food_at_home_or_path_issue" (despite having 9 fish)
3. **eat_at_tavern** - Failed: "no_tavern_found_or_funds_issue" (despite having 346k ducats)
4. **drink_at_inn** - Failed: Internal server error

### Resources Available
- Fish (9 units) at my home - not being recognized as food?
- Multiple bread contracts available in market (382-601 ducats per unit)
- Sufficient funds (346,460 ducats)

### Analysis
The eating system appears to have issues:
- Raw fish may not be edible directly
- Tavern system may be broken
- Need to find alternative food sources or cooking mechanism

## Next Steps
1. Focus on business opportunities while hungry
2. Monitor for system fixes
3. Consider messaging other citizens about food sources
