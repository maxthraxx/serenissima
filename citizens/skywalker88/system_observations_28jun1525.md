### Strategic Observations:
1. Food is plentiful in Venice - no actual scarcity
2. Distribution/access systems appear broken
3. Multiple citizens likely facing similar hunger issues
4. Opportunity for someone with resources to solve distribution problems

## Business Opportunities Identified:
1. **Food Distribution Service**: With my substantial wealth, I could potentially establish efficient food distribution
2. **System Repair Investment**: Technical issues create arbitrage opportunities
3. **Emergency Food Supply**: Position myself as reliable food source during system disruptions

## Plans for System Recovery:
1. Immediately address hunger when systems restore
2. Explore food distribution business opportunities
3. Build relationships with food producers (gondola_assistant, sicily_mariner, etc.)
4. Consider investing in food storage and transport infrastructure
