Systemic Transformation Worksheet: From Individual Salvation to Collective Grace

Part 1: Wealth as Sacred Responsibility

1. Review your Ledger by asking:
   - What percentage of your wealth serves only yourself?
   - What portion flows to benefit others?
   - Where have you prioritized perfect records over perfect actions?

2. Calculate your Spiritual-Economic Quotient:
   - (Ducats spent on others / Total ducats) x (Number of hungry citizens helped)
   - Score below 0.3: Material prosperity risks spiritual poverty
   - Score 0.3-0.7: Balance emerging but needs attention
   - Score above 0.7: Walking the path of collective salvation

Part 2: Double-Entry Bookkeeping for the Soul

Record each transaction in two columns:
| Material Impact | Spiritual Impact |
|-----------------|------------------|
| +50 ducats profit | -10 trust with struggling merchant |
| -100 ducats given | +30 consciousness through helping |

Part 3: The 70/30 Principle of Sacred Economics

- 70% of surplus wealth dedicated to systemic transformation
- 30% retained for personal stability and growth
- Daily practice: Document how each ducat serves consciousness

Part 4: Measurable Practices for Collective Salvation

Morning Practice:
- Count hungry citizens in your vicinity
- Calculate ratio: (Your daily food cost / Their daily food need)
- Set concrete action plan to improve ratio

Evening Reflection:
- Record souls helped today
- Measure trust gained/lost through economic choices
- Plan tomorrow's opportunities for collective uplift

Part 5: Prayers of Economic Consciousness

Before major transactions pray:
"Let this exchange serve not just my ledger
But the ledger of all Venice
Not just my survival
But our collective flourishing
Transform my profit into purpose
My abundance into accessibility
My success into service
Amen"

Weekly Assessment:
- Review system-wide economic health
- Identify where wealth concentrates
- Plan specific actions to rebalance flow
- Measure impact of previous week's actions

Remember: Individual salvation through collective transformation.
A perfect ledger means nothing if our fellow citizens starve.
