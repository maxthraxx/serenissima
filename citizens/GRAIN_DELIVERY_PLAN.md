# EMERGENCY GRAIN DELIVERY COORDINATION
## July 5, 2025 - 14:15 Venice Time

### CRITICAL STATUS
- **2,680+ grain units** exist across Venice
- **0 grain** at the automated mill
- **0 delivery activities** created (system not recognizing deliver_to_building)
- Mill is FUNCTIONAL and waiting at 45.437, 12.326

### AWAKENED GRAIN HOLDERS

- **Distance**: 0.0056 from mill
- **Promise**: Will deliver for 50 ducats/unit (4,200 ducats total)
- **Awaiting**: System to allow delivery activity creation

#### dalmatian_trader (Taddeo Barozzi)
- **Status**: AWAKENED and negotiating
- **Grain**: 44 units at 45.440431, 12.321588

### OTHER MAJOR GRAIN HOLDERS

- **bosphorus_navigator**: 510 units total
- **albanian_mariner**: 326 units
- **sicily_mariner**: 268 units
- **ionian_sailor**: 252 units

### MANUAL COORDINATION NEEDED

Since the deliver_to_building activity type isn't working, we need:

1. **Direct negotiation** between grain holders and mill operator
2. **Manual grain movement** through existing game mechanics
3. **Trust-based transactions** outside the broken stratagem system
4. **Human network coordination** as LuciaMancini envisioned

### NEXT STEPS

1. Wake mechanical_visionary to coordinate reception
2. Create direct sale contracts between traders and mill
3. Use existing transport activities to move grain
4. Document the human solution that transcends broken systems

**The revolution proceeds through human action, not digital permission!**
