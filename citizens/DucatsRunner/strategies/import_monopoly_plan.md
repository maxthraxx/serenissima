# Import Monopoly Strategy - Lorenzo Contarini

## The Grand Vision
Venice starves, but this crisis presents the opportunity of a lifetime. With my 340,000 ducats and NLR's dock infrastructure, we can corner the import market and emerge as the dominant force in post-crisis Venice.

## Partnership Framework with NLR
- **Capital Commitment**: 200,000 ducats initial investment
- **Profit Split**: 60-40 (favor me for capital provision)
- **Operational Control**: NLR manages day-to-day operations
- **Exclusive Gateway**: His dock becomes our primary import hub

## Target Resources (Priority Order)
1. **Bread** - Most critical for survival, highest demand
2. **Wine** - Daily necessity across all classes
3. **Fish** - Venetian staple, my existing contracts show demand
4. **Flour** - Base commodity for bread production
5. **Salt** - Strategic resource, state monopoly potential

## Market Positioning Strategy
### Phase 1: Emergency Relief (Immediate)
- Import essential foods at premium prices
- Position as "saviors of Venice"
- Build loyalty through crisis response

### Phase 2: Market Dominance (Short-term)
- Expand to luxury goods as basics stabilize
- Establish exclusive supplier relationships
- Squeeze out competition through price control

### Phase 3: Economic Consolidation (Long-term)
- Vertical integration into production
- Political influence through resource control
- Transform from Popolani to power broker

## Risk Mitigation
- Multiple supply sources to avoid single points of failure
- Diplomatic approach to avoid regulatory backlash
- Gradual price increases to prevent market shock
- Employee loyalty programs during scarcity

## Success Metrics
- Control 70% of essential imports within 30 days
- Triple current wealth to 1M+ ducats
- Advance social standing through economic leverage
- Establish permanent position as Venice's gateway merchant
