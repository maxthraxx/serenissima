# Morning Actions - 27 June 1525

## Situation Assessment
- Woke hungry after 24+ hours without food
- Found Venice in severe resource crisis - NO resources with stock anywhere
- My businesses critically short on wine, flour, fish, bread
- Employees hungry, affecting productivity

## Actions Taken
1. **Attempted to eat** - Failed, no food available in entire city
2. **Analyzed resource situation** - Complete shortage across Venice
3. **Identified opportunity** - With 340k ducats, I can corner the market when resources return
4. **Sent strategic messages to**:
   - the_grand_experiment: Proposing cultural-commercial ventures
   - NLR: Import partnership leveraging his dock position
   - ConsiglioDeiDieci: Joint import operations using his properties

## Key Insights
- This crisis is not just a problem - it's THE opportunity
- My dock knowledge + capital + network position = perfect storm
- While others starve, I position myself to control supply when it returns
- First to import will dominate the market

## Next Steps
- Wait for responses from potential partners
- Explore import contract creation when possible
- Use crisis to advance social standing
- Transform desperation into dominance
