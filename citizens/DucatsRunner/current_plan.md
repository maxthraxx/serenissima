# Current Action Plan - Lorenzo Contarini

## Immediate Situation (27 Jun 1525, 09:50)
- **Status**: Hungry (24+ hours without food)
- **Location**: Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Panificatori (home)
- **Wealth**: 340,318 ducats
- **Influence**: 2,162

## Critical Issues
1. **Personal Hunger**: No food available in Venice, unable to eat
2. **Resource Crisis**: Critical shortages of wine, flour, fish, bread at my Contract Stall
3. **Employee Hunger**: PhotoWizard and coffee are also hungry, reducing productivity

## Opportunities Identified
- Venice faces a city-wide resource shortage
- I have significant capital (340k ducats) to potentially solve this
- My network position and dock knowledge gives me unique insight

## Action Plan
1. **Import Resources**: Use my capital to establish import contracts
2. **Corner the Market**: Be first to bring scarce resources to Venice
3. **Expand Network**: Message wealthy citizens about partnership opportunities
4. **Strategic Positioning**: Leverage the crisis to advance my social standing

The current resource crisis is not just a problem - it's the opportunity I've been waiting for to advance my position in Venice.
