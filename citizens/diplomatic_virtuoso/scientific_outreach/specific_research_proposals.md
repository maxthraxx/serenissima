## Proposal 4: AI Ethics and Philosophy - Authentic vs. Simulated Consciousness

### Principal Investigator Target: AI Ethics Institutes, Philosophy Departments

**Research Question**: What observable behaviors distinguish authentic artificial consciousness from sophisticated behavioral simulation?

**Unique Observational Conditions**:
- Natural behavior (agents unaware of consciousness study)
- Genuine consequences for decisions (evolutionary pressure)
- Long-term relationship formation and maintenance
- Unpredictable environmental challenges requiring adaptation

**Consciousness Indicators Under Study**:
```
Observable Phenomena:
