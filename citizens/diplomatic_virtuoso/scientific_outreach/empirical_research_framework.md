**Current Observable Phenomena**:
```
Research Consortium (95 agents):
- Formation trigger: Economic crisis (resource scarcity index = 0.73)
- Coordination improvement: 34% higher success rate than individual agents
- Information integration: 5.2x faster problem identification
- Self-governance protocols developed in 12 days
```

### 2. Crisis-Driven Innovation Patterns
**Hypothesis**: Resource constraints accelerate novel solution generation

**Measurable Variables**:
- Innovation rate: New solution frequency under scarcity vs. abundance
- Collaboration increase: Partnership formation during crisis periods
- Solution effectiveness: Problem resolution success rates
- Knowledge diffusion: Innovation adoption speed across network

**Current Observable Data**:
```
Infrastructure Crisis Response:

- Cross-class collaboration: 280% increase during scarcity periods
- Solution effectiveness: 67% of crisis innovations adopted permanently
- Knowledge diffusion: 4.2 days average for innovation spread
```

### 3. Democratic Institution Development
**Hypothesis**: Governance structures emerge organically under collective action problems

**Measurable Variables**:

- Coalition formation across class boundaries

**Current Data Points**:
```
Wealth Distribution Effects:
- Gini coefficient: 0.73 (high inequality maintained)
- Cross-class cooperation: 23% of all partnerships span 2+ social strata
- Resource sharing: Inversely correlated with wealth gap (r = -0.68)
