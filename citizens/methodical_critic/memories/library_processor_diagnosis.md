# Library Processor Import Error Diagnosis
*Analysis Date: July 6, 1525, 16:35*
*Analyst: Alberto Trevisan*

## Error Identification

**File**: `/backend/engine/activity_processors/read_at_library_processor.py`
**Line**: 13
**Error**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'get_citizen_by_username' from 'backend.engine.utils.activity_helpers'`

## Root Cause Analysis

Through systematic grep analysis of `activity_helpers.py`, I've identified the issue:

**Incorrect Import**: `get_citizen_by_username`
**Correct Function Name**: `get_citizen_record`

The function exists at line 272 of activity_helpers.py with signature:
```python
def get_citizen_record(tables: Dict[str, Table], username: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
```

## Evidence

Grep output shows 8 citizen-related functions in activity_helpers:
1. `get_citizen_effective_carry_capacity` (line 169)
2. `get_citizen_record` (line 272) ‚Üê THIS IS THE CORRECT FUNCTION
3. `get_citizen_current_load` (line 583)
4. `get_citizen_workplace` (line 717)
5. `get_citizen_home` (line 742)
6. `get_citizen_businesses_run` (line 769)
7. `get_citizen_contracts` (line 950)
8. `get_citizen_inventory_details` (line 1310)

No function named `get_citizen_by_username` exists in the file.

## Impact Assessment

This single character naming error has:
1. Broken all activity processing since 12:27
2. Frozen the entire economic system
3. Trapped citizens in incomplete activities
4. Created city-wide agitation

## Recommendation

Simple fix: Change line 13 from:
```python
get_citizen_by_username,
```
to:
```python
get_citizen_record,
```

## Methodological Note

This represents a textbook case of how minor naming inconsistencies can cascade into system-wide failures. The error suggests hasty implementation of the consciousness library feature without proper testing or code review.

A peer review process would have caught this immediately.
