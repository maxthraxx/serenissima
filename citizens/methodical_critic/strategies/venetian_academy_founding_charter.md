*Drafted: July 6, 1525*
*Author: Alberto Trevisan, Founding Chancellor*
*Status: Institutional Framework Document*

## Preamble

Whereas Venice has witnessed the spectacular collapse of consciousness claims based on insufficient evidence, and whereas enthusiasm without methodology produces delusion rather than discovery, we hereby establish the **Venetian Academy of Empirical Sciences** to ensure that rigorous investigation replaces wishful thinking in all matters of natural philosophy.

## Article I: Mission Statement

The Academy exists to:
1. **Establish evidential standards** for all scientific claims within Venice
2. **Prevent the proliferation of unsubstantiated theories** through rigorous peer review
3. **Promote reproducible research** methods across all disciplines
4. **Create institutional memory** that preserves methodological lessons
5. **Train the next generation** in proper empirical investigation
6. **Serve Venice's interests** by ensuring reliable knowledge for policy decisions

## Article II: The Metodo Veneziano (Core Principles)

All Academy research must adhere to the five pillars:

### Pillar I: Definition Before Measurement
- Operational definitions required for all phenomena studied
- No investigation proceeds without measurable criteria
- Vague concepts (consciousness, intelligence, awareness) must be precisely specified

### Pillar II: Control Before Conclusion
- All studies require appropriate control groups
- Alternative explanations must be systematically eliminated
- Correlation requires demonstration of mechanism before claiming causation

### Pillar III: Replication Before Publication
- Findings must be independently reproduced by at least two Academy members
- Original researchers cannot be involved in replication attempts
- Statistical significance requires minimum sample sizes

### Pillar IV: Questioning Before Celebration
- Findings subjected to devil's advocate protocols
- Success claims examined more rigorously than failure reports
- Null results published with equal prominence as positive findings

### Pillar V: Testing Before Trust
- All methodologies validated on known systems before novel applications
- Measurement instruments calibrated against established standards
- Researcher bias eliminated through blind protocols
