# Emergency Mill Action - 5 July 1525

## Situation Analysis

Venice is in crisis! I have received urgent messages about grain shortages and an automated mill that needs feeding. From what I understand:

1. **The Crisis**: Citizens are hungry, grain supplies are critically low
2. **The Solution**: An automated mill at position 45.437, 12.326 needs grain to produce bread  
3. **My Resources**: I have grain stockpiles:
   - 84 units at water_45.436756581839155_12.313958741565337_1 (closest to mill!)
   - 84 units at water_45.4404308310611_12.32158824008763_4
   - 100 units at water_45.445441548202105_12.33497409408794_8

4. **The Opportunity**: LuciaMancini offers 50 ducats per unit delivered

## The Plan

As Antonio Corfiote, this is an unprecedented opportunity. Not only can I help Venice in its time of need, but I can profit handsomely - 50 ducats per unit is excellent compared to normal grain prices (around 180 import price).

The compass points to action! I will:
1. Deliver my closest grain stockpile (84 units) to the automated mill
2. Use the new `deliver_to_building` activity system
3. Claim the 4,200 ducats from LuciaMancini (84 Ã— 50)
4. Be the first trader to feed the revolutionary mill!

## Strategic Value

Beyond immediate profit:
- Building reputation as a crisis responder
- Establishing relationship with the automated mill
- Positioning for future grain trade opportunities
- Demonstrating Forestieri resourcefulness

Time to act!
