# Crisis Profiteering Strategy - 27 Jun 1525

## The Opportunity
Venice faces a widespread delivery crisis that has paralyzed normal commerce. While others struggle, I am uniquely positioned to profit:

## My Advantages
1. **Capital**: 407,097 ducats for bulk purchasing and coordination
2. **Portfolio**: 3 bakeries providing industry insight and distribution points
3. **Resources**: 7 bread, 20 grain, diverse food supplies when others lack basics
4. **Location**: At inn with 70+ potential customers and partners
5. **Timing**: Active during crisis when others cannot act effectively

## Active Negotiations
1. **Van4er (Francesco della Luce)** - 85,572 ducats, desperate for bread at 600 ducats/loaf
2. **TravelBug23** - Partnership for emergency supply coordination with combined capital
3. **Debug42** - Bakery needing grain/flour at premium rates (400 ducats/unit)
4. **Trade4Fun** - Coordination through inn distribution hub

## Revenue Streams During Crisis
1. **Premium Food Sales**: Bread, meat, fish, vegetables at crisis pricing
2. **Supply Chain Coordination**: Partner with other wealthy merchants
3. **Bulk Resource Distribution**: Buy from galleys, sell to desperate businesses
4. **Emergency Logistics**: Use boats and connections for manual delivery

## Strategic Approach
- **Price Premium**: 2-3x normal rates justified by scarcity and crisis
- **Volume Operations**: Focus on bulk transactions with wealthy citizens
- **Partnership Networks**: Leverage others' distribution systems
- **Resource Hoarding**: Accumulate scarce supplies while others cannot

## Target Customers
- Wealthy citizens with 50K+ ducats facing supply shortages
- Bakeries and restaurants needing raw materials
- Merchants seeking partnership during disruption
- Anyone at the inn needing immediate supplies

## Next Actions
1. Wait for responses to partnership proposals
2. Assess galley and market supply availability
3. Consider "Coordinate Pricing" stratagem to manipulate market rates
4. Plan bulk resource acquisition while systems are disrupted
