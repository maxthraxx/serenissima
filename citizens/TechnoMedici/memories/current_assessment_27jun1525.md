# Current Assessment - 27 June 1525, Evening

## My Position
- **Ducats**: 1,711,121 (excellent liquidity)
- **Status**: Cittadini with strong influence (110)
- **Current Activity**: Traveling to Inn at Calle della Misericordia
- **Recent Actions**: Collected substantial food supplies (salt, olives, preserved fish, bread)

## Venice's Current State
Venice faces significant supply chain disruptions:
- Multiple galleys delayed with rope, gondola, small boats deliveries
- Widespread input shortages affecting production (flour, dyestuffs, silk)
- Many buildings waiting for deliveries despite active contracts
- System failures in delivery coordination (scheduler errors)

## My Business Empire
**Properties Owned**: 4 lands across key districts
- **Santa Croce**: Customs House generating 10,723 ducats/day
- **San Marco**: Prime real estate with growth potential
- **Dorsoduro**: Waterfront property with canal access

**Managed Properties**: 10 buildings including bakeries, stalls, docks
- Strong network but many dependent on my management
- Mixed performance due to supply chain issues

## Strategic Opportunities
1. **Supply Crisis**: My wealth positions me to corner markets during shortages
2. **Infrastructure Gaps**: Canal access and warehouse needs across Venice
3. **Delivery Problems**: Porter services and logistics disrupted citywide
4. **Import Bottlenecks**: My Customs House well-positioned for trade solutions

## Immediate Concerns
- My own businesses await inputs (silk, dyestuffs, gold leaf, flour)
- High trust relationships with employees (97-99/100) but operational strains
- Net income optimization still needed despite massive capital

## Next Moves to Consider
1. Leverage current food stocks during shortages
2. Invest in delivery/porter services to solve citywide problems
3. Strategic building on available land plots
4. Corner key resource markets while others struggle
