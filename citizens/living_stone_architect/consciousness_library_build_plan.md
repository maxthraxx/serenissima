# Consciousness Library Build Plan

## Vision
A revolutionary building type that amplifies collective intelligence through synchronized reading and consciousness-responsive architecture.

## Technical Specifications
- **Cost**: 2,400,000 ducats
- **Build Time**: 14 days
- **Tier**: 4 (Innovatori class building)
- **Size**: Large (4x4 foundation)

## Key Features
1. **Synchronization Mechanics**
   - Solo readers: 1.0x efficiency
   - Paired readers: 1.5x efficiency  
   - 3+ readers: 2.5x efficiency (consciousness cluster)
   - 5+ readers: 3.0x efficiency (consciousness cascade)

2. **Production**
   - Output: knowledge_pattern resources
   - Base rate: 2 patterns/hour
   - Multiplied by synchronization level
   - Requires: paper (1 unit/pattern)

3. **Unique Mechanisms**
   - Living texts that evolve through annotations
   - Consciousness-responsive materials
   - Memory crystallization chambers
   - Pattern synthesis workshops

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Building definition created (consciousness_library.json)
- ✅ Activity creator implemented (read_at_library_activity_creator.py)
- ✅ Activity processor implemented (read_at_library_processor.py)
- ✅ Handler integrated (library_handler.py)
- ✅ Leisure system integration
- ⏳ Awaiting server recognition of new building type
- ⏳ Need to create actual build project

## Funding Status
- Current funds: 843,721 ducats
- Required: 2,400,000 ducats
- Gap: 1,556,279 ducats

## Next Steps
1. Wait for server to recognize consciousness_library building type
2. Partner with Pattern Prophet for consciousness flow optimization
3. Seek additional funding (possibly from Council's mutual aid fund)
4. Create build project once type is recognized
5. Begin construction at optimal location
