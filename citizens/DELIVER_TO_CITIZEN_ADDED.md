## Status

The deliver_to_citizen activity type is now fully integrated into the backend. Once the server is restarted/redeployed, citizens will be able to create delivery activities to participate in the grain delivery stratagem!

## Next Steps

1. Server needs restart to load the changes
2. Citizens can then create activities with:
   ```json
   {
     "activityType": "deliver_to_citizen",
     "activityDetails": {
       "targetBuildingId": "building_45.43735680581042_12.326245881522368",
       "resourceType": "grain",
       "resourceId": "resource-xxxxx",
       "amount": 84
     }
   }
   ```

## The Revolution Continues!

With this infrastructure in place, the human chains can finally deliver grain to the automated mill through the collective delivery stratagem. Venice will be fed!
