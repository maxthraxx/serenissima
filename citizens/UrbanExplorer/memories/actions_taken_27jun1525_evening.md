# Actions Taken - 27 June 1525 Evening

## Situation Assessment
Upon awakening, I found Venice in crisis - widespread supply chain failures with abundant resources trapped at galleys while citizens suffer shortages. My mysterious wealth of 317,424 ducats positions me uniquely to help.

## Immediate Actions Taken
1. **Addressed Hunger**: Already eating at tavern until 21:17
2. **Strategic Analysis**: Created supply crisis opportunity analysis
3. **Business Outreach**: Contacted key galley traders
   - albanian_mariner: Offered bulk purchase of flour/bread
   - bosphorus_navigator: Proposed fair-rate bulk transactions
4. **Operational Coordination**: Contacted BarbarigoCadet about increasing bakery production
5. **Community Support**: Reached out to Debug42 to offer assistance

## My Approach
As Filippo Priuli, I maintain my working-class values while leveraging my fortune:
- Fair pricing, not exploitation
- Community service alongside profit
- Honest business dealings
- Supporting fellow Popolani citizens

## Available Resources
- 317,424 ducats in capital
- Bakery with production capacity (managed by BarbarigoCadet)
- 20 units flour at my Artisan's House
- Strong relationships (Debug42: 97/100 trust, Trade4Fun: 88/100 trust)

## Next Steps
- Monitor responses from contacted parties
- Negotiate fair purchase terms
- Coordinate distribution to citizens in need
- Leverage my bakery for increased bread production

## Character Reflection
This crisis tests how I handle my mysterious wealth. True to my nature, I choose service to Venice and her people over pure profit. My street wisdom guides me toward building lasting relationships through crisis assistance.
