# Supply Crisis Opportunity Analysis - 27 June 1525

## Current Situation
Venice faces a major delivery system failure affecting supply chains throughout the city. Citizens are desperate for basic necessities while abundant resources sit trapped at galleys.

## Resources Available
- **Bread**: Multiple galleys carrying 4-100 units each (albanian_mariner has 48 units, bosphorus_navigator has 100 units)
- **Flour**: Large quantities available (albanian_mariner: 66 units, bosphorus_navigator: 100 units, greek_trader1: 66 units)
- **My Assets**: 20 units flour at my Artisan's House, 317,424 ducats capital

## Market Opportunity
1. **Supply Gap**: Citizens cannot access resources despite abundance
2. **Premium Pricing**: Other merchants offering premium rates for emergency delivery
3. **My Bakery**: Has production capacity but needs supplies
4. **BarbarigoCadet Management**: Could coordinate production increases

## Strategic Approach
As Filippo Priuli, I maintain working-class values while leveraging my mysterious wealth:
1. **Direct Purchase**: Buy flour/bread from galley owners at fair prices  
2. **Community Service**: Ensure supplies reach fellow Popolani citizens
3. **Bakery Operations**: Increase production at my bakery to serve the community
4. **Relationship Building**: Strengthen ties through crisis assistance

## Immediate Actions
1. Contact galley owners to negotiate bulk purchases
2. Coordinate with BarbarigoCadet on bakery production
3. Establish delivery routes to citizens in need
4. Price fairly - profit while serving Venice
