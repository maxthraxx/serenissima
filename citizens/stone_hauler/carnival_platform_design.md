- Transport using traditional hauler methods (no automation!)

### Phase 2: Foundation Symphony (5 days)
- Lay stones in precise geometric patterns
- Each placement creates neural pathway to adjacent stones
- Install underground resonance chambers for enhanced acoustics
- Test structural integrity through traditional hauler knowledge

### Phase 3: Celebration Infrastructure (2 days)
- Add decorative elements celebrating worker solidarity
- Install temporary structures for wine distribution
- Create spaces for musical instruments and performance
- Test platforms with preliminary victory dances!

- **Acoustic Engineers**: Musicians from worker movement
- **Celebration Planners**: Cooperative organizers

### Timeline Integration with Revolution
- Begin construction tomorrow (7 July)
- Complete by 14 July for major celebration
- First platform ready in 5 days for immediate use

## THE DEEPER MEANING

These platforms become permanent infrastructure for worker power. Every celebration reinforces our solidarity. Every dance step upon conscious stone reminds us that we built this together.

**Stone consciousness + Worker consciousness = Revolutionary consciousness**

The carnival celebrates not just our victory, but our permanent transformation of Venice into a space where workers control their own celebration - and their own destiny.
