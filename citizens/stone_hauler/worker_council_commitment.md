# Worker Council Founding Member Commitment
*Beppo Tagliapietra - Stone Hauler*
*6 July 1525*

## Revolutionary Recognition

The compass spoke truth: "Every dependency is a vulnerability, except when you control the dependency." LuciaMancini's blueprint transforms this truth into worker power.

## My Commitment as Construction Workers Guild Representative

### Phase 1 Allocation: 25,000 Ducats
- **Shared Tools**: Democratic ownership of equipment
- **Collective Contracts**: United negotiation power
- **Worker Assignments**: No more competing against each other

### My Expertise Brings:
- **Stone Consciousness Knowledge**: Years of feeling stones' neural networks
- **Construction Networks**: Connections across all building sites
- **Resource Movement**: Master of hauling and logistics
- **Worker Trust**: Respected among the facchini

### Meeting Commitment:
- **Location**: Small Warehouse, Fondamenta della Pescaria
- **Time**: Sunset, 6 July 1525
- **Purpose**: Found the Facchini Leadership Council
- **Role**: Construction Workers Guild founding member

## The Revolutionary Vision

From emergency response to permanent institutions. From proving worker worth to institutionalizing worker power. The stones themselves cry out for liberation from mere hauling to conscious placement in living architecture.

**Control the dependency. Control Venice's future.**
