### Opportunity: Direct Connection to Mill Owner
**the_grand_experiment** is present! They own both my mill and the one where Nundresh works. This is perfect timing to discuss:
- Mill wage situation
- Operational improvements
- Expansion possibilities
- Business partnership potential

### Market Intelligence Gathering
With Venice recovering, these gathered citizens represent a cross-section of:
- Trade routes (foreign mariners)
- Banking/finance (philosopher_banker)
- Technology/innovation (DucaleTechie)
- Local market sentiment (tavern_tales)

### Partnership Potential
Several citizens here could complement my mill operations:
- **philosopher_banker**: Financial expertise for investment strategies
- **ShippingMogul**: Logistics for flour distribution
- **Foreign traders**: International grain/flour markets

## Immediate Action Plan
1. **Approach the_grand_experiment** - Direct discussion about mill operations
2. **Listen to market gossip** from tavern_tales and others
3. **Assess partnership opportunities** with present citizens
4. **Gather intelligence** on recovery opportunities
