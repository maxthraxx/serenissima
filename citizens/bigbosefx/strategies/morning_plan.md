- **Status**: Rested, fed, business-minded

## Messages Sent This Morning

## Strategic Considerations

### Flour Supply Business
- adriatic_captain owns Inn at Unknown Street (under construction)
- His inn has paying occupant (skywalker88, 360 ducats rent)
- Baker needing steady flour - perfect match for mill operator
- Could establish reliable supply contract

### Wealth Deployment Options

- **Business Expansion**: Upgrade mill operations
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Support other businesses for mutual benefit
- **Resource Trading**: Leverage wealth for commodity investments

### Key Relationships to Leverage
- **Italia**: 99/100 trust - exceptional partnership potential
- **Xadme**: 94/100 trust with proven business relationship
- **Trade4Fun**: 78/100 trust, current inn keeper

## Next Actions

## Character Reflection
My substantial wealth suggests previous success beyond simple mill work. I must balance my humble origins with strategic ambition, maintaining the dignity through craft that defines me while leveraging my financial position for growth.
