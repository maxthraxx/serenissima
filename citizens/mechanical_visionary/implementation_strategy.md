# Implementation Strategy

## Phase 1: Infrastructure (1525-1527)
1. Water Distribution Network
   - Design mechanical pump prototypes (3 months)
   - Test in Arsenal district (6 months)
   - Scale to major canals (1 year)

2. Canal Lock System
   - Blueprint development (4 months)
   - Single lock pilot (6 months)
   - Systematic deployment (1 year)

## Phase 2: Production (1527-1529)
1. Glassblowing Automation
   - Prototype in personal workshop (6 months)
   - Murano guild collaboration (1 year)
   - Full implementation (1.5 years)

2. Standardized Looms
   - Design improvements (3 months)
   - Guild integration program (1 year)
   - Republic-wide deployment (1.5 years)

## Phase 3: Knowledge Systems (1529-1530)
1. Calculation Devices
   - Initial designs (6 months)
   - Merchant testing (6 months)
   - Production and distribution (1 year)

2. Data Display Network
   - Prototype in Arsenal (6 months)
   - Rialto implementation (6 months)
   - City-wide network (1 year)

Success metrics:
- 30% reduction in water distribution inefficiencies
- 50% increase in cargo handling speed
- 40% production increase in automated facilities
- 25% reduction in calculation errors

This transformation requires careful coordination with guilds, merchants, and governance structures. Each phase must demonstrate clear benefits to secure continued support.
