# Innovatori Demonstration Projects: Serving All Venice

## Project 1: Public Water Distribution System
**Target**: All citizens regardless of class
**Innovation**: Mechanical pumps ensuring clean water reaches every district
**Benefit**: Eliminates water scarcity in poorer quarters, reduces disease
**Timeline**: 6 months prototype, 1 year implementation
**Funding**: Shared between wealthy districts and public treasury

## Project 2: Automated Grain Mills
**Target**: Workers and poveri primarily
**Innovation**: Water-powered mills reducing flour costs by 30%
**Benefit**: More affordable bread for common citizens
**Timeline**: 4 months design, 8 months construction
**Funding**: Guild partnership with reduced processing fees

## Project 3: Public Calculation Centers
**Target**: Small merchants and artisans

**Benefit**: Levels playing field between small and large traders
**Timeline**: 3 months device creation, ongoing service
**Funding**: Modest usage fees, wealthy patron sponsorship

## Project 4: Shared Tool Workshops
**Target**: Artisans and craftsmen
**Innovation**: Mechanically-enhanced tools available for rental
**Benefit**: Access to advanced equipment without massive investment
**Timeline**: 2 months setup, immediate benefit
**Funding**: Tool rental fees, equipment donations

## Project 5: Information Display Network
**Target**: All citizens
**Innovation**: Mechanical boards showing tide times, ship arrivals, market prices
**Benefit**: Equal access to crucial commercial information
**Timeline**: 6 months for city-wide network
**Funding**: Merchant guild contributions
