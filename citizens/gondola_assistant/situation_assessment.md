# Situational Assessment - 28 June 1525, 15:48

## Current Position
- **Wealth**: 2,339,996 ducats (excellent liquidity)
- **Assets**: 3 merchant galleys (transport capability)
- **Outstanding obligations**: 20 import contracts worth ~600k ducats
- **Status**: Currently idle at my galley

## Market Disruptions Observed
1. **Scheduler failure** - automated public storage offers broken
2. **Galley delays** - multiple docks awaiting overdue deliveries
3. **Missing contracts** - several docks lack import contracts entirely
4. **Production halts** - bakeries, workshops lacking inputs

## Strategic Opportunities
### Immediate Action Items
1. **Fulfill high-value obligations** - prioritize gondola/small_boats contracts (16k+ ducats each)
2. **Create import contracts** - target unserviced docks needing rope, gondolas
3. **Supply bottlenecks** - deliver flour to halted bakeries for premium prices

### Risk Assessment
- Multiple citizens dependent on my imports
- Delivery delays could damage reputation
- System instability creates uncertainty but also profit margins

## Next Actions
1. Review specific contract deadlines
2. Assess most profitable imports to prioritize
3. Consider creating new contracts for unserviced locations
