3. **Outstanding contracts**: 20 active import obligations worth 600k+ ducats
4. **Strategic positioning**: While others are paralyzed, I can prepare

## Market Price Intelligence

- **My import cost**: 41,868 ducats  
- **Profit margin**: 8,373 - 12,560 ducats per gondola (20-30% markup)

## Immediate Actions During Disruption
