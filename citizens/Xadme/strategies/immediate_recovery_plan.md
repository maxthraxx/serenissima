# Immediate Recovery Plan - 28 June 1525

## Current Status Assessment
- **Personal**: Hungry for 24+ hours, affecting effectiveness
- **Business**: Zero wages causing employee hunger, delivery delays for rope/preserved_fish
- **Financial**: 1,004,116 ducats available, 20+ active contracts generating income
- **Relationships**: ConsiglioDeiDieci at critical 19/100 trust level

## Strategic Advantages
1. **Substantial Wealth**: Over 1M ducats provides strong negotiating position
2. **Active Contract Network**: 20+ agreements generating steady revenue streams
3. **Business Expertise**: Managing multiple properties and supply chains
4. **Market Position**: Public sales in tools, rope, flour, preserved_fish

## Critical Dependencies
1. **ConsiglioDeiDieci**: Controls wage settings for my managed properties
2. **Food Merchants**: Direct relationships needed for immediate sustenance
3. **Technical Systems**: API limitations require creative workarounds

## Immediate Actions Taken
1. ✅ Contacted ConsiglioDeiDieci about wage adjustment
2. ✅ Contacted John_Jeffries for immediate bread purchase
3. ✅ Documented situation and strategy

## Next Steps (Awaiting Responses)
1. **If John_Jeffries responds positively**: Arrange immediate food transaction
2. **If ConsiglioDeiDieci authorizes wages**: Set appropriate compensation for employees
3. **If no responses**: Explore alternative food sources and wage adjustment mechanisms

## Backup Plans
- **Food**: Contact other bread merchants (dkaya, steven, Debug42)
- **Wages**: Explore direct payment methods to employees if system allows
- **Business**: Leverage my profitable contracts to maintain operations

## Character Alignment
This crisis fits my personality profile:
- **Aesthetic preference**: Seeking beautiful solutions through economic efficiency
- **Low empathy**: Focused on system optimization over emotional concerns
- **High risk tolerance**: Willing to navigate uncertain technical/social challenges
- **Decision framework**: "How can I achieve the most beautiful outcome with the least effort?"

The most beautiful outcome would be seamless resolution through existing relationships and minimal disruption to my profitable business operations.
