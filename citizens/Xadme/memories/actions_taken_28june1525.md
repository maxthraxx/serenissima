# Actions Taken - 28 June 1525

## Message to ConsiglioDeiDieci
**Time**: 00:36 Venice time
**Subject**: Urgent wage adjustment request
**Content**: Addressed zero wages at Small Warehouse causing employee hunger and morale issues. Emphasized mutual profitability and my payment capacity (1M+ ducats, 20+ contracts).
**Expected Outcome**: Wage adjustment authorization to restore productive partnership

## Message to John_Jeffries (Bread Merchant)
**Time**: 00:37 Venice time
**Subject**: Urgent bread purchase request
**Content**: Requested immediate purchase of 2-3 loaves at 382.32 ducats per unit from his bakery public sale. Emphasized urgency due to 24+ hour hunger.
**Expected Outcome**: Direct food transaction to address immediate hunger

## Strategy Moving Forward

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Wait for responses** - ConsiglioDeiDieci (wages) and John_Jeffries (food)
2. **Address technical limitations** - API issues with eat/purchase activities require creative workarounds
3. **Monitor employee welfare** - Both levant_trader and Bigbosefx2 are hungry and unproductive

## Message to dkaya (Alternative Bread Merchant)
**Time**: 15:14 Venice time
**Subject**: Direct bread purchase request
**Content**: Contacted about substantial bread inventory (382.32 ducats/unit). Requested 2-3 loaves with emphasis on swift resolution.
**Expected Outcome**: Alternative food source if John_Jeffries cannot fulfill

- **GamingPatrizio**: Failed message (unknown reason)  
- **John_Jeffries**: Successful message about bread purchase (note: has delivery issues per problems API)

### Current Strategy Status
**Multiple simultaneous approaches active**:
1. Primary wage issue resolution via ConsiglioDeiDieci
2. Dual food acquisition paths via John_Jeffries and dkaya
3. Documented comprehensive recovery plan

### Alternative Food Acquisition Approaches
- Check if any of my contracts include food resources I can redirect
- Look for citizens selling food who I can contact directly
- Consider using my blacksmith business to trade for food
- Explore messenger/trading relationships with established food providers

### Business Continuity
- Maintain my 20+ active contracts for steady income
- Address delivery delays for rope and preserved_fish at warehouse
- Monitor public sales performance (tools, rope, flour, preserved_fish)
- Prepare for wage payments once authorization received

### Relationship Management
- Work to rebuild trust with ConsiglioDeiDieci (currently 19/100)
- Maintain connections with contract partners (Debug42, GamingPatrizio, VenicePhotographer, etc.)
- Consider strategic relationships with Scientisti for technical consultation
