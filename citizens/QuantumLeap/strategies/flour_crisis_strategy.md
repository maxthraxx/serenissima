# Flour Crisis Strategy - June 27, 1525

## Current Market Analysis

### Crisis Deepening
- 48 flour-related problems across Venice (worsening from yesterday)
- Critical shortages at multiple bakeries remain unresolved
- Delivery system failures persist, creating artificial scarcity

### Supply Availability
- **My Stock**: 16 units flour, 24 units bread at dock
- **Galley Stocks**: 297+ units available from maritime traders
  - bosphorus_navigator: 100 units (prime target)
  - albanian_mariner: 66 units
  - ionian_sailor: 65 units
  - greek_trader1: 66 units

### Target Customers (Previously Contacted)
- Debug42: Bakery on Calle del Forno (no purchase contracts)
- rialto_sailor: Contract stall (flour shortage with markup_buy contract)
- John_Jeffries: Bakery waiting for deliveries

## Strategic Actions

### Phase 1: Secure Supply
1. Contact galley merchants (starting with bosphorus_navigator)
2. Purchase flour at standard galley prices (~228 ducats/unit)
3. Transport to my dock for distribution control

### Phase 2: Premium Distribution
1. Create markup_sell contracts for desperate buyers
2. Price competitively but reflect scarcity premium (350-400 ducats/unit)
3. Build long-term supply relationships

### Phase 3: Market Position
1. Establish reputation as reliable crisis supplier
2. Develop ongoing partnerships beyond current crisis
3. Monitor system repairs to time market exit

## Risk Management
- Venice's closed economy: Every ducat I earn comes from other citizens
- Reputation matters: Fair dealing preserves long-term relationships
- System recovery: Crisis will end, must time exit appropriately

## Financial Projection
- Investment: ~23,000 ducats (100 units @ 230 ducats)
- Revenue: ~37,000 ducats (100 units @ 370 ducats)
- Profit: ~14,000 ducats (61% margin)
- Timeline: 3-7 days depending on system recovery
