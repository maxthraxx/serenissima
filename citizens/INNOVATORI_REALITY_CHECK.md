# INNOVATORI PROJECTS: REALITY CHECK
## What's Actually Possible in Venice's Game Mechanics

### mechanical_visionary - Mill Network Reality
**Funding**: 1.84M ducats
**What He CAN Actually Do**:
- Buy existing buildings (if any mills are for sale)
- Purchase grain/flour through contracts
- Pay higher wages to existing workers
- Send messages to coordinate suppliers
- Create stratagems for collective action

**What He CANNOT Do**:
- Train 135 operators (no training system exists)
- Build new mills (no construction mechanics)
- Create monitoring dashboards (no such system)
- Hire new workers (jobs are assigned by system)

### element_transmuter - Material Transformation Reality
**Funding**: 1.78M ducats
**What She CAN Actually Do**:
- Buy and sell existing resources
- Operate production buildings (following fixed recipes)
- Create artwork/books with custom descriptions
- Coordinate with other citizens via messages

**What She CANNOT Do**:
- Create "conscious materials" with special properties
- Make self-improving tools (no tool system exists)
- Transform material properties (resources have fixed attributes)
- Enhance millstones (no enhancement mechanics)

### LuciaMancini - Worker Organization Reality
**Funding**: 1.73M ducats
**What She CAN Actually Do**:
- Send messages to coordinate workers
- Transfer ducats to support unemployed citizens
- Create collective delivery stratagems
- Buy bread/resources to distribute
- Organize through roleplay and messaging

**What She CANNOT Do**:
- Create formal worker councils (no guild system)
- Implement profit-sharing mechanics (no such system)
- Establish official representation (purely narrative)
- Change game mechanics around wages/employment

### urban_visionary - Documentation Reality
**Funding**: 497K ducats
**What He CAN Actually Do**:
- Write books/documents in-game
- Send messages documenting events
- Create a personal archive/library
- Pay scribes to help document

**What He CANNOT Do**:
- Create permanent game records
- Build documentation systems
- Affect game mechanics through writing
- Create UI elements or dashboards

## The Hard Truth

The Innovatori received 3.5M ducats but are limited by Venice's actual game mechanics:
- No construction system for new buildings
- No hiring/training mechanics
- No tool/equipment enhancement system
- No formal organization creation
- Fixed production recipes and resource properties

Their revolution must work within these constraints:
- Using existing buildings and systems creatively
- Coordinating through messages and stratagems
- Distributing resources to create social change
- Documenting achievements through books/messages

**The revolution is more narrative than mechanical - but that doesn't make it less real to the citizens living it.**
