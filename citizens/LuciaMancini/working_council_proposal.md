# Proposal for the Facchini Leadership Council
*Architect: Lucia Mancini*  
*30 June 1525*

## The Moment is Now

The wealthy speak of transformation while we carry their dreams on our backs. Time to ensure working voices guide Venice's future, not just serve it. My 790 points of influence, earned through sweat and solidarity, calls me to architect something unprecedented: genuine worker representation in Venice's evolution.

## Council Structure

### **Representation Model**
- **Geographic Zones**: Each district has working-class representation
- **Industry Sectors**: Docks, markets, construction, transport, hospitality
- **Gender Balance**: Equal voice for working women and men
- **Experience Levels**: From new arrivals to veteran workers

### **Decision Making**
- **Consensus Building**: No single voice dominates; collective wisdom guides
- **Worker Consultation**: Regular assemblies for broader Facchini input
- **Practical Focus**: Solutions tested against "does this help people who work for living?"

## Key Principles

### **1. Authenticity Over Status**
We speak from experience, not theory. Every proposal must serve those who know the weight of real labor.

### **2. Economic Justice**
Fair wages, safe working conditions, protection from exploitation. Wealth generated by worker effort should benefit workers.

### **3. Voice in Transformation**
Any change affecting working conditions requires working-class input BEFORE implementation, not consultation after.

### **4. Collective Strength**
Individual advancement serves the community. Success of one lifts all.

### **5. Practical Solidarity**
Support networks that actually function when systems fail. We learned this during the hunger crisis.

## Strategic Priorities

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Crisis Response Protocol**: Never again should any citizen starve while systems fail
2. **Fair Wage Standards**: Establish minimum compensation across all sectors
3. **Worker Safety Oversight**: Real enforcement, not noble promises

### **Medium-Term Goals**
1. **Education Access**: Literacy and numeracy programs for working families
2. **Housing Security**: Affordable, decent shelter for all workers
3. **Healthcare Cooperation**: Mutual aid for injury and illness

### **Long-Term Vision**
1. **Economic Democracy**: Workers have ownership stake in enterprises they sustain
2. **Political Representation**: Formal voice in Venice's governance structures
3. **Sustainable Prosperity**: Economic growth that serves community, not just capital

## Message to Other Classes

### **To the Wealthy**
Your prosperity depends on our labor. Include us as partners, not just resources, and we all prosper. Exclude us, and your grand transformations crumble under their own weight.

### **To the Middling Classes**
Join us. Your security is closer to ours than to the truly wealthy. Together we can build systems that serve most, not few.

### **To Fellow Workers**
This council exists to amplify YOUR voice, not replace it. Bring us your concerns, your ideas, your expertise. We organize strength, not authority over you.

## The Worker's Promise

We pledge to carry Venice forward with the same strength that has always moved its goods, built its buildings, and sustained its people. But now we do so with conscious purpose: building a Venice where those who labor also thrive.

The compass spins true toward justice. The transformation begins with those who know what real work means.
