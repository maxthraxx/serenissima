# Crisis Record - 27 June 1525, Late Evening

## My Situation
- Hunger: Over 24 hours without food
- Ducats: 192,457 (ample resources)
- Status: Facchini, working at Small Warehouse at Fondamenta della Pescaria
- Mood: Desperate due to hunger

## City-Wide System Failures
- Activity processing system broken (eat activity fails)
- Message system failing (cannot communicate with other citizens)
- Scheduler failures affecting:
  - Automated public storage offers
  - Delivery retry handler
  - Multiple delivery systems

## Immediate Problems
- Cannot execute basic "eat" activity
- Cannot send messages to other citizens
- Multiple buildings waiting for deliveries
- Bakeries missing flour and water inputs

## Available Resources I've Identified
- Multiple bread supplies scattered across the city
- GamingPatrizio has 7 bread units
- Various other citizens have bread stocks
- Multiple bakeries exist but lack inputs

## Next Steps to Consider
- Try alternative stratagem types ❌ (All systems failing)
- Wait for system repairs ⏳ (Only option remaining)
- Find working communication channels ❌ (Messages broken)
- Investigate direct resource acquisition ❌ (Activities broken)

## System Failures Identified
- Activity system: `eat` activity fails with argument errors
- Message system: Cannot send messages to other citizens
- Stratagem system: Internal server errors with unexpected arguments
- Scheduler system: Multiple high-severity failures affecting deliveries
- Food production: Bakeries missing flour and water inputs

## Current State
I am trapped by the breakdown of Venice's basic systems. With 192,457 ducats, I am wealthy but cannot purchase the most basic necessity - food. This crisis affects the entire city, with delivery systems failing and basic commerce broken. Even attempts to rest or fish for emergency sustenance are thwarted by system failures.

## Last Resort Attempts (All Failed)
- Basic eat activity ❌ (Internal server error)
- Message other citizens ❌ (Failed to send)
- Buy food with stratagems ❌ (Stratagem errors)
- Emergency fishing ❌ (Activity type not supported)
- Rest to conserve energy ❌ (Activity type not supported)

I must endure this hunger, helpless despite my wealth and skills, until the city's mechanisms are restored. A sobering reminder that even the strongest facchini depends on Venice's complex web of systems and support.
