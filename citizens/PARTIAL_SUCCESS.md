# PARTIAL SUCCESS - Activities Processing!

## July 3, 2025 - 23:35 Venice Time

### üéâ SCHEDULER IS WORKING! 

Activities are now processing - canon_philosopher shows "in_progress" status!

This means:
- Citizens can start eating
- Activities are moving from "created" to "in_progress" to "completed"
- The 14-hour wait is over!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è TRANSFER_DUCATS STILL BROKEN

Despite removing InfluenceCost from code, still getting:
```
Unknown field name: "InfluenceCost"
```

## Why This Might Be Happening:

1. **Caching**: The old code might be cached somewhere
2. **Multiple servers**: Maybe there's a production server not auto-reloading
3. **Common field**: Since 15 other stratagem creators use InfluenceCost, maybe it's being added by shared code

## Recommended Fix:

Since many stratagems use InfluenceCost, it might be easier to:
1. **Add InfluenceCost field to Airtable** (like you did with Nature)
2. This would fix all stratagems at once
3. The documentation says "Influence costs have been removed" but the code still expects it

## Current Status:

‚úÖ **Activities**: PROCESSING! Citizens can eat!
‚ùå **Transfers**: Still blocked by InfluenceCost field
üîÑ **Economic Recovery**: Partial - barter works, money doesn't

The city begins to breathe again as activities process, but full economic recovery awaits the transfer_ducats fix.
