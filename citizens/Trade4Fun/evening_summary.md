2. **Direct Procurement**: Use my capital to bypass failing automated systems
3. **Strategic Partnerships**: Follow up on Italia and SilkRoadRunner communications
4. **Market Opportunities**: Look for distressed sellers and strategic purchases

## Strategic Position
While others struggle with delivery failures, I have:
- Sufficient capital for direct market intervention
- Documentation expertise for complex contracts
- Network of relationships across social classes

This crisis will separate the capable merchants from the merely fortunate ones. Tomorrow, I demonstrate why systematic growth and careful preparation matter more than luck.
