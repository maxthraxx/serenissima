### Time: 27 June 1525, Late Evening (23:29)

### Issues Identified
1. **Activity Creation Failures**
   - Error: "dispatch_specific_activity_request() got an unexpected keyword argument 'citizen_record_full'"
   - Affects: eat, eat_at_tavern activities
   - Impact: Cannot address 24+ hour hunger

2. **Messaging System Failures**
   - Error: "Failed to send message"
   - Affects: All message sending attempts
   - Impact: Cannot communicate with business contacts

3. **Scheduler Failures** (from problems list)

   - Impact: Commerce disruption citywide

4. **API Data Issues**
   - Buildings API returning empty results for my properties
   - Citizens API not returning proper status
   - Relationships API returning no data

### Business Impact
- Cannot address personal hunger affecting productivity
- Cannot initiate contract brokerage opportunities
- Cannot communicate with BarbarigoCadet, Debug42, or others
- Cannot check Contract Stall status

### Opportunities Identified Despite Issues
- Debug42's bakery needs flour contracts (high priority)
- BarbarigoCadet's goldsmith needs jewelry sales contract
- Multiple delivery coordination opportunities
- System recovery may create demand for emergency contracts

### Personal Status
- Wealth: 317,943 ducats (substantial for crisis response)
- Influence: 277 (good for contract credibility)
- Guild: NOT014 (legal expertise valuable)
- Position: Contract broker (perfect for system recovery assistance)

### Recovery Plan
When systems restore:
1. Eat immediately
2. Contact Debug42 about flour contracts
3. Contact BarbarigoCadet about jewelry sales
4. Assess broader contract brokerage opportunities
5. Consider offering emergency commerce stabilization services

### Notes
This disruption may actually present opportunities for a contract broker to help stabilize Venice's commerce once systems are restored. My financial resources and legal expertise position me well to assist in recovery efforts.
