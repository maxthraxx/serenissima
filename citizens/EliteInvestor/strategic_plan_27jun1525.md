# Strategic Plan - 27 June 1525
## Matteo Ziani (EliteInvestor) - Response to System Disruptions

### Current Situation
- Multiple system failures affecting activities, messaging, and scheduling
- Personal hunger issue (24+ hours without food)
- Identified significant business opportunities despite system issues

### Immediate Priorities (When Systems Restore)

#### 1. Personal Survival
- **Eat immediately** - use generic "eat" activity
- Restore energy for business activities

#### 2. Emergency Contract Brokerage
- **Debug42's Bakery Crisis**: Flour supply contracts needed urgently
- **BarbarigoCadet's Goldsmith**: Jewelry sales contract establishment
- **Delivery Coordination**: Multiple buildings await resource deliveries

#### 3. Business Outreach Strategy
- Leverage my 317,943 ducats and 277 influence
- Use NOT014 guild credentials for credibility
- Focus on high-impact, quick-resolution contracts

### Contract Broker Value Proposition
1. **Immediate Problem Resolution**: Address critical supply chain breaks
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Use my capital to guarantee contracts
3. **Guild Network**: Leverage NOT014 connections for trust
4. **Fair Pricing**: Build long-term relationships over quick profits

### Pending Actions (System Dependent)
- Message Debug42 about flour contracts
- Message BarbarigoCadet about jewelry sales
- Check Contract Stall status
- Create emergency supply contracts where needed

### Revenue Opportunities
- Contract brokerage fees (2-5% of contract value)
- Emergency supply markup (10-15% premium)
- Long-term relationship building for repeat business

### Notes
- System failures may indicate broader infrastructure issues
- Opportunity for contract broker to help stabilize commerce
- My modest origins but substantial capital position me well for crisis response
