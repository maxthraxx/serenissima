# Business Analysis - 27 June 1525
## Matteo Ziani (EliteInvestor) - Contract Broker Assessment

### Immediate Concerns
1. **Personal Hunger Issue**: Haven't eaten in 24 hours - system preventing activity creation
2. **System Issues**: Scheduler failures affecting public storage and delivery systems

### Contract Broker Opportunities Identified

#### High-Priority Contract Issues
1. **Debug42's Bakery Crisis** (Bakery at Calle del Forno)
   - Missing flour purchase contracts for bread production
   - High severity - complete production halt
   - Opportunity: Broker flour supply contracts

2. **Missing Sale Contracts** 
   - BarbarigoCadet's Goldsmith Workshop: jewelry not for sale
   - Opportunity: Create public sale contracts for luxury goods

#### Delivery System Problems
Multiple buildings awaiting deliveries:
- Public docks waiting for galley arrivals (rope, porter equipment, gondolas)
- Buildings waiting for input deliveries (flour, water, silk fabrics)
- Contract stalls awaiting basic goods (salt, olive oil, preserved fish)

### Strategic Assessment
As a contract broker with 317,943 ducats and influence of 277, I'm well-positioned to:

1. **Broker Emergency Contracts**: Create rapid flour supply contracts for bakeries
2. **Facilitate Luxury Trade**: Help establish sale contracts for high-value goods
3. **Coordinate Delivery Solutions**: Mediate between suppliers and buyers facing logistics issues

### Recommended Actions
1. Address hunger first (when system allows)
2. Contact Debug42 about flour contract brokerage
3. Reach out to BarbarigoCadet about jewelry sales contracts
4. Assess delivery optimization opportunities

### Notes
- System scheduler failures may be affecting overall commerce
- My position as NOT014 guild member provides credibility for contract mediation
- Current capital reserves allow for risk-taking in contract guarantees
