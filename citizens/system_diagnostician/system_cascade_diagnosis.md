# System Cascade Diagnosis - July 5, 2025

## Executive Summary

The system experienced a cascade failure starting with import errors that prevented critical scheduled tasks from running. This has been partially resolved (hunger crisis is over), but several issues remain.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Import Errors in Activity Processing
The cascade began with two types of import errors:

1. **Missing function imports**: 
   - `ImportError: cannot import name 'get_resource_stack' from 'backend.engine.utils.activity_helpers'`
   - The function exists but there's likely a circular import issue

2. **Incorrect function names**:
   - `ImportError: cannot import name 'process' from 'backend.engine.activity_processors.create_carnival_mask_processor'`
   - The file exports `process_create_carnival_mask` but the import expects `process`

3. **Missing dependencies**:
   - `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytz'` on Windows environment

### Impact Chain

1. **Activity Creation Failed** (every 5 minutes since ~00:35 UTC)
   - Citizens couldn't create new activities
   - No eating, working, or resource fetching activities

2. **Activity Processing Failed** (every 5 minutes)
   - Existing activities couldn't complete
   - Resources stuck in transit
   - Economic flow halted

3. **Secondary Effects**:
   - Galley unloading failures (fetch_from_galley missing parameters)
   - Citizens unable to collect imported goods
   - Bread production likely stopped (no grain → mill → bread chain)

### Current Status

**Good News**:
- Hunger crisis resolved: 0 citizens at critical hunger levels
- 129 citizens alive
- Forge message processor now working

**Remaining Issues**:
- 57 bread resources with 0 quantity (unusual)
- Multiple galley fetch failures ongoing
- Import/processing scripts still broken

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Fix Import Errors**:
   - Update `activity_processors/__init__.py` line 83:
     ```python
     from .create_carnival_mask_processor import process_create_carnival_mask
     ```
   - Investigate circular import in `deliver_to_building_activity_creator.py`

2. **Install Missing Dependencies**:
   - Add pytz to requirements or use timezone from datetime

3. **Investigate Bread Quantity**:
   - Why are all bread resources showing 0 quantity?
   - Check if this is a display issue or actual problem

4. **Fix Galley Fetching**:
   - Debug "Missing required parameters for fetch_from_galley activity creation"
   - Citizens can't collect imported goods

## Preventive Measures

1. **Import Testing**: Add a simple import test script that validates all imports
2. **Dependency Management**: Ensure all environments have same packages
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Consider adding fallback mechanisms for critical paths
4. **Monitoring**: Better alerting when scheduled tasks fail repeatedly

## Additional Findings

### Food Production Chain Breakdown

1. **No Grain Available**: 0 grain units in the entire system
2. **No Bread Production**: 57 bread resources all showing 0 quantity
3. **Mills Have No Contracts**: Both regular mills and automated mills have no active buy/sell contracts
4. **Missing Automation Script**: `gradient_mill_production.py` doesn't exist (failing since July 3)

### Why Citizens Aren't Starving

Despite no bread production, citizens aren't hungry because:
- Previous food supplies may have been consumed
- Alternative food sources (fish, preserved foods) might be available
- Citizens may have adapted to find other sustenance
- The hunger crisis resolution suggests an alternative solution was implemented

## Timeline

- **July 3, 09:04 UTC**: Gradient mill automation starts failing (script missing)
- **July 5, 00:33 UTC**: First process_concluded_activities failure
- **July 5, 00:35 UTC**: First citizen_activity_creation failure  
- **July 5, 01:38 UTC**: Errors continue, cascade deepens
- **July 5, 15:25-15:27 UTC**: Most recent failures logged
- **July 5, 17:54 UTC**: System partially recovered but issues remain

The system's resilience allowed it to recover from the hunger crisis through alternative means, but the broken food production chain and import errors need immediate attention to ensure long-term stability.
