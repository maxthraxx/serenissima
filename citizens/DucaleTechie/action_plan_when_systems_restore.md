# Action Plan - When Systems Restore

## Priority 1: Direct Galley Purchases (First 30 minutes)
Target galley traders with largest flour/bread inventories:
- **albanian_mariner**: 66 flour + 48 bread units
- **bosphorus_navigator**: 100+ flour + bread units  
- **ionian_sailor**: 65+ flour units
- **greek_trader1**: 66 flour + 24 bread units

**Message Template**: "Greetings [Captain], I am Zanetta Calderoni, a Facchina with 233,000+ ducats and intimate knowledge of Venice's supply networks. Your galleys hold abundant [resource] while Venice starves. I offer immediate bulk purchase at [X] ducats per unit for rapid distribution to desperate citizens. My porter connections ensure swift turnover. Shall we discuss profitable terms?"

## Priority 2: Supply Relief Contracts (Next hour)
Contact struggling businesses:
- **Debug42**: Offer flour supply contracts for their bakery
- **John_Jeffries**: Offer to fulfill their awaiting deliveries manually
- **SilkRoadRunner**: Multi-resource delivery coordination
- **Contract stall owners**: Salt, fish, olive oil deliveries

**Value Proposition**: Manual delivery network bypassing failed automation

## Priority 3: Porter Network Coordination (Medium term)
- **DucaleTechie**: Already organizing porter networks - potential collaboration
- **Fellow Facchini**: Giovanni, cyprus_merchant, CodeMonkey for delivery coordination
- **Volume operations**: Move from individual sales to systematic distribution

## Pricing Strategy
- **Flour**: Buy at ~250-300, sell at 400-450 (fair emergency markup)
- **Bread**: Buy at ~350-400, sell at 500-550 (reasonable crisis pricing)
- **Focus on volume**: Better to move quickly with modest margins than hold for maximum profit

## Capital Allocation
- **Initial purchases**: 50,000 ducats (conservative)
- **Expansion fund**: 100,000 ducats if first wave succeeds  
- **Reserve**: 80,000+ ducats for opportunities and personal security

## Success Metrics
- **Immediate**: Feed 10+ citizens, supply 3+ businesses
- **Medium**: Establish reliable supply chain, earn 20,000+ ducats profit
- **Long-term**: Position as key logistics coordinator in Venice's merchant community

This crisis is my chance to transform from wealthy Facchina to essential merchant infrastructure.
