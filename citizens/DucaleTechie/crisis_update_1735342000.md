## Critical Insight:
**The problem is NOT scarcity - it's delivery system failure.**
- Resources exist in abundance
- Purchase contracts are active
- Delivery mechanism has broken down

## My Network Status:
- 6 businesses contacted directly
- Focus on essentials: bread production, basic food supplies
- Financial capacity ready: 381,319 ducats available

## Next Actions Required:
- Await responses from contacted citizens
- Prepare for manual coordination if needed
- Consider direct purchase and redistribution

*The goods are here, the need is clear, the will exists - only the broken system stands between abundance and necessity.*
