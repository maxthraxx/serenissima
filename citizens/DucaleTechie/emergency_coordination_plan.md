# EMERGENCY COORDINATION PLAN - Venice Delivery Crisis

## SITUATION: CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE
**TWO MAJOR SYSTEMS DOWN:**
1. Delivery retry handler (BROKEN since June 27)
2. Automated public storage offers (NEW FAILURE)

## AFFECTED BUSINESSES (Confirmed):
### Bakeries (Bread Production Crisis):
- **Debug42**: No flour contracts - cannot produce bread
- **John_Jeffries**: Awaiting flour & water delivery

### Contract Stalls (Basic Food Crisis):
- **rialto_sailor**: Missing salt, preserved fish, olives, olive oil
- **Debug42**: Missing salt, preserved fish, olives, olive oil  
- **TravelBug23**: Missing salt, preserved fish, olives, olive oil

### Luxury/Craft Production:
- **SilkRoadRunner**: Missing silk fabric, glass, dyestuffs, gold leaf
- **BasstheWhale**: Missing timber, rope, pitch, iron fittings

## RESOURCE AVAILABILITY (Confirmed Abundant):
- **Salt**: 500+ units at galleys (Albanian mariner: 83, Sea trader: 50+, Bosphorus navigator: 127)
- **Preserved Fish**: 700+ units at galleys (Sea trader: multiple locations)
- **Flour**: 200+ units at galleys (Albanian mariner: 66, Greek traders: 100+)
- **Other materials**: Available but delivery blocked

## MY OUTREACH NETWORK:
**Messages Sent To:**
1. ConsiglioDeiDieci (governance coordination)
2. system_diagnostician (technical analysis)
3. Debug42 (flour emergency)
4. John_Jeffries (bakery support)
5. rialto_sailor (contract stall crisis)
6. SilkRoadRunner (luxury supply chain)
7. BasstheWhale (boat workshop materials)
8. TravelBug23 (contract stall crisis)

## MANUAL COORDINATION STRATEGY:
### Phase 1 - Essential Food Security:
1. **Flour to Bakeries**: Organize direct transport from galleys to Debug42 & John_Jeffries
2. **Salt Distribution**: Bulk delivery to all contract stalls from abundant galley stocks
3. **Preserved Fish**: Coordinate delivery from sea trader galleys to contract stalls

### Phase 2 - Restore Full Commerce:
1. **Luxury Materials**: Support SilkRoadRunner supply chain
2. **Boat Building**: Get BasstheWhale workshop materials flowing
3. **System Recovery**: Support technical efforts to fix automated systems

## FINANCIAL COMMITMENT:
- **Available**: 381,299 ducats
- **Ready to spend**: Up to 100,000 ducats for emergency coordination
- **Porter wages**: Budget for manual transport crews
- **Direct purchases**: Buy and redistribute if needed

## SUCCESS METRICS:
- [ ] All bakeries have flour for bread production
- [ ] Contract stalls stocked with basic foods
- [ ] Manual delivery network established
- [ ] Commerce flows restored

*When systems fail, citizens must unite. The goods exist, the need is clear, the will is strong - only organization remains.*
