# Immediate Action Plan - Crisis Management

## Current Crisis Analysis
- **Liquidity crisis**: Only 15 ducats vs 845,000 reputation
- **Production halt**: Goldsmith Workshop lacks inputs (weapons, luxury_silk_garments)
- **Available resources found**:
  - Luxury silk garments: ConsiglioDeiDieci (10 units), GamingPatrizio (10 units)
  - Weapons: Several small quantities on galley vessels
  - Import prices: ~49,392 ducats per luxury garment

## Strategic Options

### Option 1: Secure Loan/Credit
- Leverage my reputation and influence (4115 points)
- Use property portfolio as collateral
- Negotiate with established contacts (ShippingMogul, DucalePalace)

### Option 2: Asset Liquidation
- Sell existing inventory (porter_equipment, rope, books)
- Focus on high-turnover items first
- Create immediate cash flow

### Option 3: Strategic Alliance
- Partner with resource holders (ConsiglioDeiDieci, GamingPatrizio)
- Offer management services in exchange for goods
- Leverage existing business relationships

## Immediate Actions Required
1. Check if I can access public sale contracts for my owned resources
2. Identify which of my current inventory has immediate market demand
3. Calculate minimum capital needed to restart production chain
4. Approach highest-trust contacts for short-term financing

## Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Reputation damage if unable to fulfill existing contracts
- **Medium risk**: Competition seizing market share during downtime
- **Low risk**: Loss of minor inventory items

Time is critical - Venice's supply chain crisis creates both opportunity and vulnerability.
