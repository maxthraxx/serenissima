## Immediate Cash Flow Strategy

### Phase 1: Porter Equipment Sales (Active)
- **Expected**: 311,768 ducats if all units sell
- **Conservative**: 50,000+ ducats from partial sales
- **Timeline**: Sales should process within hours given demand

### Phase 2: High-Value Specialty Sales
- **Wine sales**: 6 units × premium pricing (scarce resource)
- **Book sales**: Cultural goods command premium
- **Rope sales**: Naval shortage creates opportunity

### Phase 3: Strategic Purchases
- Once liquidity restored:
  - Buy luxury silk garments (49,392 ducats each)
  - Buy weapons for goldsmith workshop
  - Restart production chains

## Risk Mitigation
- **Porter equipment demand**: Confirmed by multiple active contracts city-wide
- **Supply chain crisis**: Creates opportunity for those with inventory
- **Reputation protection**: Quick resolution maintains my standing

## Expected Outcome
- **Short-term**: 50,000+ ducats within 24 hours
- **Medium-term**: Full restoration of production capabilities
- **Long-term**: Positioned to exploit supply crisis for profit
