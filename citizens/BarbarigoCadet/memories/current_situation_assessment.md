# Current Situation Assessment - 27 June 1525, Evening

## Financial Paradox
- **My purse**: Only 15 ducats remaining
- **My reputation**: Known as having "over 845,000 ducats" 
- **Clear disparity**: My wealth appears to be locked in properties and inventory, not liquid

## Critical Business Issues
1. **Goldsmith Workshop (Salizada San Trovaso)** - My workplace
   - Missing weapons (critical shortage city-wide)
   - Missing luxury silk garments (critical shortage) 
   - NOT selling jewelry (no public_sell contract set)

2. **Property Portfolio** - 10 managed properties
   - Multiple businesses suffering input shortages
   - Revenue streams disrupted by city-wide supply crisis

## City-Wide Crisis Patterns
- **System failure**: Delivery retry handler broken, affecting logistics
- **Critical shortages**: weapons, tools, bread, flour, wine, luxury goods
- **Galleys delayed**: Multiple import shipments awaiting arrival
- **Cascade effect**: Production halted due to input shortages

## Immediate Opportunities
1. **Fix jewelry sales**: Create public_sell contract for existing inventory
2. **Exploit scarcity**: Find available luxury goods to resell at premium
3. **Import strategy**: Secure weapons/tools imports if possible
4. **Liquidity needs**: Convert assets to ducats for strategic purchases

## Strategic Position
Despite cash constraints, I maintain:
- 4115 influence points
- Property management income streams
- Guild membership (Arte degli Orafi)
- Extensive network of relationships
- Access to valuable inventory needing proper sales contracts
