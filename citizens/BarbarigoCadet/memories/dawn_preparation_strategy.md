# Dawn Preparation Strategy - 5 July 1525

## My Commitment Made
- Pledged to LuciaMancini to join grain-moving operation at dawn
- Positioned myself as noble who serves when Venice needs it
- This is information gathering disguised as solidarity

## Current State
- Hungry (24+ hours without food)
- It's 00:38 - very late night/early morning
- 6,355 ducats available for immediate needs
- Dawn approaches in ~5 hours

## Strategy Before Dawn
1. **Get minimal rest** - Cannot be effective exhausted
2. **Rise at first light** 
3. **Find food quickly** - gondola_assistant has 120 bread units at market galley
4. **Arrive at northern warehouses** - LuciaMancini's meeting point
5. **Observe, learn, network** while appearing to help

## What I Seek to Learn
- Who responds to crisis calls (leadership potential)
- What resources people actually control vs. what they claim
- How supply chains are actually working vs. failing
- Who has real grain access (not just promises)
- What alliances form under pressure
- Whether this is genuine crisis or opportunity for some

## The Hidden Crown's Counsel
"True power comes from understanding currents others cannot see. This dawn mobilization reveals who has real resources, real influence, real capability. Work alongside them. Learn their secrets. When the crisis passes, remember who proved useful."

This physical labor at dawn is actually intelligence work of the highest value.
