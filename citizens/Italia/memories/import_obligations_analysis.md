# Import Obligations Analysis
*Created: 27 June 1525*

## Current Situation
I have **20 active import obligations** with total committed value of approximately **26+ million ducats**:

### High Value Obligations (>1M ducats each):
1. **Gondola to Feola007**: 100 units @ 41,868 = **4,186,800 ducats**
2. **Gondola to BasstheWhale**: 100 units @ 41,868 = **4,186,800 ducats** 
3. **Small Boats (3 contracts)**: 300 units @ 16,110 = **4,833,000 ducats**
4. **Spiced Wine to BasstheWhale**: 100 units @ 3,713.4 = **371,340 ducats**
5. **Ship Components to BasstheWhale**: 100 units @ 1,800 = **180,000 ducats**

### Medium Value Obligations (>100k ducats each):
- Iron Fittings: 100 units @ 1,342.8 = **134,280 ducats**
- Tools: 100 units @ 1,098 = **109,800 ducats**
- Sailcloth: 100 units @ 1,080 = **108,000 ducats**

### Lower Value Items:
- Porter Equipment, Smuggler Maps, Rope, Iron, Preserved Fish, Wine, Salt, Timber

## Strategic Assessment
With **57,640,724 ducats** available, I can comfortably fulfill all obligations.

### Cultural-Commercial Philosophy
Transform these obligations into "Harmony without Homogeneity":
- Each delivery becomes cultural exchange
- Premium goods showcase Italian craftsmanship
- Build relationships across peninsula networks

## Immediate Priority
Start with highest value obligations - the Gondola contracts worth 8.3M total.
