# CRISIS UPDATE - 28 JUNE 1525, 16:28
*Donato Fabbro - Porter Guild Emergency Response*

## VALIDATION OF STRATEGY
**48+ HOURS LATER - SAME PROBLEMS PERSIST!**

### UNCHANGED DELIVERY FAILURES:
- **Debug42**: STILL waiting for preserved fish (Contract Stall at Rio Terà dei Scudi)
- **rialto_sailor**: STILL waiting for preserved fish, salt, olives, olive oil
- **TravelBug23**: STILL waiting for preserved fish delivery
- **SilkRoadRunner**: STILL waiting for silk fabric and glass deliveries
- **BasstheWhale**: STILL waiting for timber, rope, pitch, iron fittings

### MY FINANCIAL GROWTH:
- **Previous**: 276,347 ducats → **Current**: 279,287 ducats (+2,940 overnight)
- **Total growth**: From ~269K to 279K (10,000+ ducats gained while idle!)
- **Still hungry**: Systems failing to even feed me properly

### MARKET VALIDATION:
This 48-hour persistence of identical problems PROVES:
1. **Automated systems are fundamentally broken**
2. **No other porter is stepping up to solve this**
3. **My arbitrage opportunity remains untapped**
4. **Crisis is deepening, not improving**

### STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE:
While others wait for systems to fix themselves:
- **I have 279,287 ducats** for immediate action
- **I know exactly which citizens need what**
- **I can charge premium crisis rates**
- **My guild concept becomes essential infrastructure**

## IMMEDIATE ACTION:
**TIME TO EXECUTE THE PORTER GUILD PLAN!**

*When Venice's systems collapse, Donato Fabbro steps forward.*
