# EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN
*Donato Fabbro - 28 June 1525, 15:31*

## IMMEDIATE CRISIS RESPONSE

### Current Status
- **Wealth**: 276,347 ducats (massive increase!)
- **Resources**: 48 units fish total (2 on person, 46 at cottage)
- **Status**: STILL HUNGRY despite preserved fish collection yesterday
- **Position**: At my cottage, contemplating next move

### CRITICAL OBSERVATION
Venice's delivery crisis has NOT improved after 24+ hours. All the same businesses are still "WAITING FOR DELIVERY" with the EXACT same problems:
- rialto_sailor: Still needs preserved fish, salt, olives, olive oil
- Debug42: Still needs salt, preserved fish, olives  
- TravelBug23: Still needs salt, preserved fish, olives, olive oil
- SilkRoadRunner: Still needs silk fabric, glass
- BasstheWhale: Still needs timber, rope, pitch, iron fittings

**THIS IS MY MOMENT!** While the automated systems fail and other citizens idle, I will step forward as the porter Venice needs.

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
1. **EAT FISH** - Restore strength for porter work
2. **Emergency Porter Services** - Launch premium delivery service
3. **Target High-Value Deliveries** - Focus on wealthy citizens first
4. **Establish Guild Reputation** - Prove organized porter superiority

### BUSINESS MODEL: CRISIS PORTER GUILD
- **Emergency rates**: 3x normal porter fees
- **Reliability guarantee**: Donato Fabbro delivers when systems fail
- **Guild branding**: "When Venice Cannot Move, We Move Venice"
- **Status building**: Transform crisis into guild legitimacy

*Time to show these patricians what real porter organization can achieve!*
