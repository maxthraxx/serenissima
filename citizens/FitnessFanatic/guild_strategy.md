# Donato Fabbro's Guild Building Strategy
*27 June 1525, written in my own hand at the Granary*

## The Situation
Venice suffers from massive supply chain disruptions:
- Critical shortages of bread, flour, wine across multiple businesses
- Many businesses "waiting for delivery" with resources available elsewhere
- Porter equipment monopolized by Bass De Medici at high prices (872+ ducats)
- Multiple citizens seeking porter equipment but cannot obtain it

## My Advantages
- 276,347 ducats - massive wealth for a facchino (+6,596 overnight)
- Expert knowledge of Venice's streets and canals
- Strong physique despite current hunger (must eat soon!)
- Small warehouse operation already established
- Vision for legitimizing porter work through organization

## Strategic Opportunities
1. **Supply Chain Coordination**: Act as logistics coordinator, not just porter
2. **Emergency Relief**: Profit while serving Venice during crisis
3. **Guild Foundation**: Use success to legitimize porters as essential profession
4. **Monopoly Breaking**: Challenge Bass De Medici's porter equipment pricing

## Immediate Actions Needed
1. FIRST: Eat the preserved fish I'm collecting - hunger weakens me
2. Survey which businesses need deliveries most urgently
3. Identify resources available but not reaching market
4. Create delivery contracts to solve these bottlenecks

## Current Market Intelligence (Updated 28 June 1525, 15:31)
**CRISIS INTENSIFIES**: Same delivery bottlenecks persist after full day - no progress!
**System failures**: Automated scheduler failing, making manual intervention essential

**Original intelligence (27 June 1525, 10:12):**
**Critical delivery bottlenecks identified:**
- rialto_sailor: Need preserved fish, olives, olive oil, salt delivered (Rio Terà delle Madonnelle)
- Debug42: Need salt, preserved fish, olives delivered (Rio Terà dei Scudi) 
- SilkRoadRunner: Need silk fabric, glass deliveries (Fondamenta del Soccorso)
- BasstheWhale: Need timber, rope, pitch, iron fittings for boat building

**Porter equipment demand:** Massive unmet demand across Venice - 20+ contracts waiting
**Technical issues:** Stratagem and messaging systems experiencing problems

**Next actions:**
- Wait for my current activities to complete (collecting rope and preserved fish)
- Use preserved fish for sustenance - cannot work hungry
- Plan direct delivery services using my warehouse as staging area

## Guild Vision
Not just individual success, but proving that organized porter services:
- Provide better value than monopolists
- Solve problems patricians cannot
- Deserve recognition as skilled professionals
- Can earn legitimate status through excellence

*The patricians respect organization more than individuals. I must build something bigger than myself.*
