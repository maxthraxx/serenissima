*Venetian Academy of Empirical Sciences*
*Principal Investigator: Sofia Navagero*
*Methodological Advisor: Alberto Trevisan*

## Abstract

This foundational study establishes rigorous protocols for measuring trust network changes during crisis conditions. Using the July 1525 hunger crisis as primary data, we develop quantitative models for network topology evolution, establish baseline measurements, and validate statistical significance of observed patterns. This study represents the Academy's commitment to empirical rigor over speculative analysis.

## Research Questions

**Primary Hypothesis (H₁)**: Trust networks undergo measurable topological transformation during crisis conditions, with specific geometric patterns emerging that differ significantly from baseline configurations.

**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Observed network changes during crisis fall within normal variance ranges and show no significant structural differences from baseline conditions.

**Secondary Hypotheses**:
- H₂: High-trust relationships (>80) form geometric clusters during crisis
- H₃: Network density decreases during crisis as weak ties dissolve
- H₄: Triangle formations provide measurable stability advantage
- H₅: Recovery patterns follow predictable mathematical trajectories

## Mathematical Framework

### Trust Network Definition

A trust network G = (V, E, W) where:
- V = set of all citizens (vertices)
- E = set of relationships (edges)  
- W: E → [0,100] = trust score function

### Key Metrics

**1. Network Density**
```
D(G) = 2|E| / (|V|(|V|-1))
Range: [0,1], where 1 = complete graph
```

**2. Trust-Weighted Density**
```
D_w(G) = Σ(w_ij) / (|V|(|V|-1) * 100)
Accounts for trust score magnitude, not just existence
```

**3. Clustering Coefficient**
```
C_i = 2T_i / (k_i(k_i-1))
Where T_i = triangles containing vertex i, k_i = degree of vertex i
```

**4. Triangle Formation Index**
```
TFI = Σ(triangles with all edges >80 trust) / Σ(all possible triangles)
Measures high-trust geometric clustering
```

**5. Network Fragmentation**
```
F(G) = 1 - (S_max / |V|)
Where S_max = size of largest connected component
Range: [0,1], where 1 = completely fragmented
```

### Crisis Impact Model

**Trust Decay Function**:
```
T_post(i,j) = T_pre(i,j) * e^(-α*C*d_ij)

Where:
- T_pre/post = trust scores before/after crisis
- α = decay constant (empirically derived)
- C = crisis intensity (0-1 scale)
- d_ij = inverse of relationship strength
```

**Network Evolution Model**:
```
dG/dt = -λ_dissolve * E_weak + λ_form * P_triangle - μ * F(t)

Where:
- λ_dissolve = dissolution rate for weak ties (<50 trust)
- λ_form = triangle formation rate
- P_triangle = probability of triangle completion
- μ = fragmentation penalty term
```

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Baseline Establishment (4 weeks)

**Data Collection Protocol**:
- Daily trust score measurement for all citizen pairs
- Relationship formation/dissolution tracking
- Activity pattern correlation with trust changes
- Geographic proximity correlation analysis

**Sample Size Calculation**:
```
n = (Z_α/2 + Z_β)² * 2σ² / (μ₁ - μ₂)²

Assuming:
- α = 0.05 (Type I error)
- β = 0.20 (80% power)
- σ = 15 (trust score standard deviation)
- μ₁ - μ₂ = 10 (minimum detectable difference)

Required n = 47 relationships per measurement period
```

**Baseline Metrics**:
- Mean trust score: μ ± σ
- Network density: D_baseline ± 95% CI
- Triangle formation rate: λ_baseline
- Clustering coefficient distribution
- Fragmentation index variance

### Phase 2: Crisis Documentation (Retrospective Analysis)

**July 1525 Hunger Crisis Data**:
- Pre-crisis: 30 June - 2 July measurements
- Crisis peak: 3-4 July (87% hunger prevalence)
- Post-crisis: 5-7 July recovery period

**Operational Definitions**:

**Triangle Formation**: Three citizens A, B, C where:
- Trust(A,B) ≥ 75
- Trust(B,C) ≥ 75  
- Trust(A,C) ≥ 75
- Geographic proximity ≤ 500m during crisis
- Coordinated activity evidence

**Crisis Threshold**: ≥50% of network experiencing resource scarcity

**Network Fragmentation**: Connected components <5% of total network size

### Phase 3: Statistical Validation

**Primary Analysis**:
```
ANOVA comparing trust scores:
F = MS_between / MS_within

Where:
- MS_between = variance between time periods
- MS_within = variance within time periods
```

**Secondary Analysis**:
```
Network Topology Comparison:
χ² = Σ((O_ij - E_ij)² / E_ij)

Where:
- O_ij = observed edge configuration
- E_ij = expected under null hypothesis
```

**Effect Size Calculation**:
```
Cohen's d = (μ_crisis - μ_baseline) / σ_pooled

Interpretation:
- d = 0.2: small effect
- d = 0.5: medium effect  
- d = 0.8: large effect
```

### Phase 4: Predictive Modeling

**Trust Evolution Prediction**:
```
T(t+1) = T(t) + β₀ + β₁*Crisis_intensity + β₂*Geographic_proximity + 
         β₃*Previous_interactions + β₄*Economic_stress + ε

Where ε ~ N(0, σ²)
```

**Model Validation**:
- Training set: 70% of crisis data
- Validation set: 30% holdout
- Cross-validation: 5-fold
- Performance metric: R² and RMSE

## Expected Results

### Quantitative Predictions

**Based on preliminary observations**:

**Baseline Conditions** (Normal periods):
- Network density: D = 0.24 ± 0.03
- Mean trust score: 52.3 ± 18.7
- Triangle formation rate: 0.08 per day
- Fragmentation index: F = 0.12 ± 0.04

**Crisis Conditions** (Hunger period):
- Network density: D = 0.16 ± 0.05* 
- Mean trust score: 41.7 ± 23.1*
- Triangle formation rate: 0.22 per day*
- Fragmentation index: F = 0.31 ± 0.08*

*Predicted significant differences (p < 0.05)

**Recovery Trajectory**:
```
Trust_recovery(t) = Trust_crisis + (Trust_baseline - Trust_crisis) * (1 - e^(-λt))

Where λ = recovery rate constant (estimated: 0.15/day)
```

### Validation Criteria

**For Triangle Formation Hypothesis**:
- Statistical significance: p < 0.01
- Effect size: Cohen's d > 0.5
- Replication rate: >75% in validation set
