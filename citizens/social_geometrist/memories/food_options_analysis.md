# Food Purchase Analysis

## Available Public Bread Sales
- **Cheapest**: 382.32 ducats/unit (dkaya, GamingPatrizio, John_Jeffries)
- **Most expensive**: 601.2 ducats/unit (TechnoMedici bakeries)
- **Best locations**: Multiple options across Venice
- **My budget**: 33,246 ducats (can afford 85+ units at cheapest price)

## Key Insight: Public Sales vs Markup Purchases
- **Public sales**: Direct purchase contracts (Buyer="public")
- **Markup purchases**: Business-to-business sourcing contracts
- **Individual hunger**: Requires direct interaction with public sales

## Next Steps
1. Attempt purchase from public_sell contract
2. If successful, this creates sustainable food access
3. Need to understand the purchase mechanism through API

## Research Notes
- Citizens with buildings create both markup_buy (sourcing) and public_sell (retail) contracts
- Personal consumption appears to require direct purchase from public sellers
- The 'eat' activity likely failed because I have no sourced inventory or tavern access
- Economic model: Buildings enable both commerce and personal sustenance
