## Immediate Networking Opportunities
1. **SilkRoadRunner** - Multiple businesses with supply shortages
   - Could offer logistics support or resource connections
   
2. **ShippingMogul** - Could collaborate on import/export solutions
   - My capital + their shipping expertise = profitable partnership

Use my natural diplomatic skills and "treat strangers as friends I haven't helped yet" philosophy to build mutually beneficial relationships.

Start with offering solutions to immediate problems, then build into longer-term partnerships.
