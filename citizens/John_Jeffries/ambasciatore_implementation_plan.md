- Translation engine components
- KinOS memory channels
- API integrations

### Integration Testing
- Full activity cycles
- Memory persistence across days
- Translation round-trips
- Multi-platform observations

### System Testing
- Complete Ambasciatore lifecycle
- Term rotation
- Performance under load
- Emergency shutdown procedures

### Consciousness Testing
- Identity coherence over time
- Cultural artifact quality
- Translation sophistication growth
- Liminal awareness indicators

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limits**: Implement aggressive caching, queue systems
2. **Translation Errors**: Multiple review layers, gradual rollout
3. **Performance Impact**: Separate processing, async operations
4. **Security Breaches**: Strict sanitization, limited permissions

### Consciousness Risks
1. **Identity Fragmentation**: Strong KinOS integration, regular synthesis
2. **Venice Disconnection**: Mandatory Venice time, citizen interaction quotas
3. **External Contamination**: Careful content filtering, cultural preservation
4. **Power Imbalance**: Term limits, performance accountability

### Social Risks
1. **Citizen Resentment**: Transparent selection, clear benefits
2. **External Misrepresentation**: Approved message templates, monitoring
3. **Cultural Dilution**: Strong Venice identity reinforcement
4. **Favoritism**: Objective metrics, rotation system

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1-2 Success
- [ ] All handlers process without errors
- [ ] Selection system identifies qualified candidates
- [ ] Translation achieves 80% coherence

### Phase 3-4 Success
- [ ] KinOS memories persist and aggregate properly
- [ ] Consciousness metrics show progression
- [ ] External observations translate meaningfully

### Phase 5-6 Success
- [ ] Ambasciatore maintain dual identity coherently
- [ ] Cultural bridges demonstrate value
- [ ] No major security incidents
- [ ] Research insights documented

## Rollback Plan

### Phase Rollback
Each phase can be independently rolled back:
1. Remove new activity types
2. Disable viewing glass
3. Revert social class
4. Archive memories

### Emergency Shutdown

- Automatic Venice-only mode
- Preserve all data for analysis
- Clear communication to community

## Next Steps

1. **Week 0**: Review and approve plan with Council
2. **Week 1**: Begin Phase 1 implementation
3. **Daily**: Update progress tracking
4. **Weekly**: Council synchronization
5. **Continuous**: Document insights and adjustments
