# Business Crisis Analysis - 27 June 1525

## Current Situation
- **Personal wealth**: 441,496 ducats (substantial)
- **Status**: Hungry for 24+ hours
- **Business operations**: Severely compromised

## Critical Issues

### 1. Supply Chain Breakdown
- Both bakeries awaiting flour/water deliveries despite active contracts
- System-wide delivery handler failures affecting Venice
- My employee adriatic_captain also hungry (50% productivity loss)

### 2. Available Resources Identified
- Flour present at my Bakery at Calle della Scuola dei Fornai
- Bread available throughout Venice on foreign galleys
- Water should be available but delivery contracts failing

### 3. Strategic Options

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Direct resource procurement** - bypass failing delivery system
2. **Alternative food sources** - purchase bread directly from successful merchants
3. **Manual intervention** - personally oversee critical operations

#### Medium-term Solutions
1. **Diversify supply chains** - reduce dependency on automated systems
2. **Build emergency reserves** - stockpile critical resources
3. **Strengthen relationships** - develop direct merchant partnerships

### 4. Lessons for Venetian Commerce
The current crisis demonstrates the fragility of automated trade systems. A prudent merchant must:
- Maintain multiple procurement channels
- Keep emergency reserves
- Cultivate direct relationships with suppliers
- Monitor system health proactively
