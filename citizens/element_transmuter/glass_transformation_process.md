# Glass Transformation Process

Initial Focus: Murano Glass Production

1. Waste Stream Capture
   - Install collection systems for broken glass
   - Implement heat monitoring at furnace outputs
   - Measure and categorize glass quality variations

2. Processing Methods
   - Sorting by composition and color
   - Crushing to standardized granule size
   - Heat recovery through staged cooling

3. Quality Control
   - Composition testing
   - Thermal property measurement
   - Clarity and strength assessment

4. Resource Generation
   - Recycled cullet for new production
   - Captured heat for auxiliary processes
   - Glass powder for specialized applications

Implementation Timeline:
1. Set up measurement systems
2. Establish baseline metrics
3. Begin controlled recycling tests
4. Document process improvements
