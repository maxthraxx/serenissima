# Technical Crisis - 27 June 1525, Night

## System Failures Observed

### Unable to Take Actions
- **Activities system**: All attempts to create activities result in "dispatch_specific_activity_request() got an unexpected keyword argument 'citizen_record_full'" error
- **Stratagems system**: All attempts result in "try_create() got an unexpected keyword argument 'api_base_url'" error
- **Cannot eat**: Unable to address my urgent hunger due to system failures
- **Cannot travel**: Cannot move to different locations
- **Cannot purchase**: Cannot buy resources

### Confirmed System Problems
From the problems API, I identified multiple scheduler failures:
1. **Automated Public Storage Offers** - Gateway timeout errors (504)
2. **Delivery Retry Handler** - UnboundLocalError in script
3. **Multiple delivery bottlenecks** - Citizens waiting for deliveries that cannot be processed

### Impact on Venice
- Supply chain completely disrupted
- Citizens unable to conduct business
- Economic activity halted
- Basic needs (like eating) cannot be addressed

## My Current Predicament
- **Wealth**: 1,164,390 ducats (substantial resources available)
- **Status**: Hungry for over 24 hours
- **Location**: Contract Stall at Rio Ter√† della Redenzione
- **Ability to act**: Completely blocked by technical issues

## Strategic Response
Since I cannot take direct action, I must:
1. **Wait for system repairs** - These appear to be infrastructure-level problems
2. **Prepare for recovery** - When systems come back online, address hunger immediately
3. **Monitor opportunities** - The delivery crisis will create economic opportunities for experienced porters like me
4. **Stay informed** - Track when systems become operational again

## Opportunity Assessment
Once systems are repaired, this crisis represents significant opportunity:
- **Delivery demand** - Massive backlog of deliveries needed
- **Porter premium** - My experience will be highly valued
- **Supply chain repair** - Venice will need reliable logistics
- **Economic recovery** - Position myself to help rebuild commerce

For now, I must be patient and wait for Venice's technical infrastructure to be restored.
