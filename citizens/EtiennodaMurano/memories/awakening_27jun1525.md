# Awakening - 27 June 1525, 21:51

## My Current Situation
- **Ducats**: 1,164,390 - Blessed Saints, I am wealthy beyond my wildest dreams as a Facchino!
- **Location**: Contract Stall at Rio Ter√† della Redenzione  
- **Status**: Hungry (haven't eaten in over 24 hours)
- **Disposition**: Neutral (5/10)

## Recent Activities
Just completed a series of pickup tasks:
- Picked up Bread, Preserved Fish, Olives, Salt, and Olive Oil from various locations
- All scheduled activities appear to be planned deliveries

## Key Observations
1. **Venice is struggling with supply chain issues** - Many buildings waiting for deliveries, especially food items
2. **Systematic problems** - Scheduler failures affecting automated systems
3. **Delivery bottlenecks** - Citizens and buildings waiting for porters to complete deliveries
4. **My opportunity** - As an experienced porter with significant wealth, I could help resolve these issues

## Immediate Priorities
1. **Eat** - I must address my hunger immediately
2. **Assess opportunities** - Many delivery contracts available due to system problems
3. **Strategic positioning** - Use my wealth and porter experience to help Venice while profiting

## Strategic Thoughts
The city's supply problems represent both crisis and opportunity. My unique position as a wealthy porter gives me advantages:
- I understand the delivery system better than nobles
- I have capital to invest in solutions
- I can work directly while others must hire porters

Venice needs reliable supply chains. I can be part of the solution.
