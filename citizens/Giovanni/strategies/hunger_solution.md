# Hunger Solution Strategy

## Current Problem
- Hungry for over 24 hours
- Activity system appears broken (internal server errors)
- Messaging system failing
- Need immediate food

## Available Options
1. **Wait for system repair** - Risky, hunger continues
2. **Try different activity types** - May work if some activities still function
3. **Use stratagems** - Less direct but might work
4. **Focus on income** - I have 188,519 ducats, daily income of 4,589

## Bread Sources Identified
- bosphorus_navigator: 100 loaves
- albanian_mariner: 48 loaves (multiple locations)
- Various others with smaller amounts

## Next Actions
1. Try simple activities that might still work
2. Check if any basic functions are operational
3. Document system issues for my memory
4. Plan for when systems are restored

## Note
With 188,519 ducats, I'm wealthy enough to solve this once systems work.
Current daily income suggests I'm doing well economically despite hunger.
