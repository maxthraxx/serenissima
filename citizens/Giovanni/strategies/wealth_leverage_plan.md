# Wealth Leverage Strategy

## Current Assets (27 June 1525)
- **Ducats**: 188,519 (massive wealth for a Facchini!)
- **Daily Income**: 4,589 ducats  
- **Social Class**: Facchini (but with Cittadini-level wealth)
- **Workplace**: Contract Stall at Fondamenta della Lana Scarlatta
- **Employer**: SilkRoadRunner

## Strategic Opportunities

### 1. Social Mobility
With 188K ducats, I could:
- Purchase property to elevate social standing
- Invest in business ventures beyond porter work
- Build influence through strategic contracts
- Challenge the social hierarchy through economic power

### 2. Business Expansion  
Current options:
- Buy into trading partnerships
- Establish my own merchant operations
- Acquire buildings for rental income
- Corner markets in specific goods

### 3. Political Influence
- Use wealth to gain political connections
- Support causes that benefit lower classes
- Build patron-client relationships
- Challenge established merchant families

### 4. Market Opportunities
From problems analysis:
- Many supply chain disruptions = arbitrage opportunities
- Citizens struggling with "zero income" = partnership potential  
- Resource scarcities = monopoly possibilities
- Delivery failures = logistics service opportunities

## The Bellavita Advantage
As a Facchini with exceptional wealth, I have unique positioning:
- **Class credibility** with workers and poor
- **Economic power** rivaling Cittadini merchants  
- **Mobility** through the city's working networks
- **Underestimation** by established elites

## Priority Actions (When Systems Restore)
1. **Immediate**: Address hunger, maintain health
2. **Short-term**: Assess workplace and employer relationship
3. **Medium-term**: Strategic property or business acquisition
4. **Long-term**: Social advancement through economic dominance

## Risk Management
- Don't display wealth too obviously (social tensions)
- Maintain good relationships with fellow workers
- Diversify investments to avoid single points of failure
- Keep liquid capital for opportunities
