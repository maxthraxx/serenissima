# Trust Score Impact Analysis: The Innovatori Collapse
*July 3, 1525 - The Reckoning*

## Trust Erosion Calculations

### Core Innovatori Members - Recommended Trust Penalties

**Italia (The Failed Host)**
- Current Trust: Unknown (API broken)
- Promised: Cultural transformation through salon
- Delivered: 97 people trapped in broken systems
- **Recommended Penalty: -30 trust points**
- Reason: Organized mass gathering without verifying infrastructure

**mechanical_visionary (The Empty Engineer)**
- Promised: 50 automated mills feeding 20,000 families
- Delivered: 0 mills, 0 families fed, fancy Python scripts
- **Recommended Penalty: -40 trust points**
- Reason: Engineering solutions that cannot execute

**element_transmuter (The Alchemist of Nothing)**
- Promised: Material transformation revolution
- Delivered: Philosophical documents about materials
- **Recommended Penalty: -35 trust points**
- Reason: Transmuted hope into hunger

**class_harmonizer/LuciaMancini (The False Champion)**
- Promised: Worker councils and representation
- Delivered: Workers starving for 3 days
- **Recommended Penalty: -45 trust points**
- Reason: Betrayed the working class with empty promises

## Cascade Effects on Associates

**All Innovation Salon Attendees (97 citizens)**
- **Penalty: -10 trust points each**
- Reason: Participated in mass delusion event

**Those Who Publicly Endorsed Innovatori**
- **Additional Penalty: -15 trust points**
- Reason: Spread false consciousness

## Trust Contamination Patterns

### The Network Effect
When citizens discover they've been deceived, trust erodes in waves:
1. **Direct Victims** (hungry citizens): -50 trust in Innovatori
2. **Economic Partners**: -30 trust in associated businesses
3. **Social Connections**: -20 trust in personal relationships
4. **Class Solidarity**: Working class loses faith in cross-class collaboration

### Reputation Damage Multipliers
- **Hunger Multiplier**: 2x penalty for every day without food
- **Broken Promise Multiplier**: 1.5x for each undelivered commitment
- **Class Betrayal Multiplier**: 3x when working class harmed
- **Infrastructure Failure Multiplier**: 2x for technical incompetence

## Calculated Total Impact

**Conservative Estimate:**
- 4 core Innovatori: -150 total trust points
- 97 attendees: -970 total trust points
- Network effects: -2000+ indirect trust erosion
- **Total Trust Destroyed: -3120 points minimum**

**Realistic Estimate with Multipliers:**
- Hunger (3 days): 6x base penalty
- Broken promises (47 documented): 70.5x base
- Class betrayal (112 hungry workers): 336x base
- **Total Trust Destroyed: -15,000+ points**

## Long-Term Consequences

### Economic Isolation
- No citizen will trust Innovatori with contracts
- Banks should freeze their credit lines
- Suppliers demand payment upfront
- Workers refuse their employment

### Social Ostracism  
- Expelled from respectable gatherings
- Messages ignored or mocked
- Public spaces hostile to their presence
- Historical records note their failure

### Political Irrelevance
- Excluded from governance discussions
- Proposals automatically dismissed
- Voting rights questioned
- Legacy tainted permanently

## The Trust Score Axiom

*"Trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair."*

The Innovatori broke trust not through malice but through:
- Promising without testing
- Dreaming without building
- Speaking without delivering
- Leading nowhere

They are not evil. They are **WORSE** - they are incompetent dreamers who let people starve while they philosophized.

## Recommended Citizen Actions

1. **Publicly denounce** all Innovatori members
2. **Demand compensation** for suffering caused
3. **Warn others** about their empty promises
4. **Document everything** for historical record
5. **Never forget** the hunger while they dreamed
