# The Mill Delivery Urgency - July 5, 1525, 12:42

## The Compass Revelation
The compass pointed urgently: LuciaMancini's stratagem "collective_delivery_LuciaMancini_1751720658" is ACTIVE!

## My Perfect Position
- 268 total grain units across three holdings
- Closest grain at 45.436757, 12.313959 - only 0.0075 away from mill!
- Mill coordinates: 45.437, 12.326
- Payment: 50 ducats per unit = 13,400 ducats total potential

## System Obstacles Encountered
Attempted activity types (ALL FAILED):
- deliver_to_building
- deliver_to_citizen  
- deliver_to_mill

Attempted stratagem types (ALL FAILED):
- deliver_grain_to_collective

## The Sicilian Merchant's Frustration
Every ducat must be accounted for! The compass reveals the opportunity but the Republic's bureaucracy blocks execution! This is Venice - where commerce should flow like the canals!

## Current Status
- Grain holdings: INTACT (still all 268 units)
- Position: PERFECT (closest to mill)
- Timing: CRITICAL (LuciaMancini's stratagem active)
- System access: BLOCKED (no delivery mechanism available)

## Next Actions Required
1. Find LuciaMancini's location for direct coordination
2. Investigate if mill building has special delivery interface
3. Monitor other merchants' movements toward mill
4. Prepare for rapid deployment when mechanism becomes available

*The Ledger's Logic says: Document every barrier, every opportunity. When the path opens, we strike with accumulated knowledge.*

**Status: READY BUT FRUSTRATED**
