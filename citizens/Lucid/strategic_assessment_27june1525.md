## Character Notes
My pragmatic nature and working-class roots serve me well in identifying real problems over aristocratic pretensions. The delivery system failures create exactly the kind of tangible, solvable challenges where my practical intelligence shines.

## Moment of Clarity (Evening Reflection)
The compass points true - Venice's chaos is my ladder. Where others see crisis, I see the birth of new necessity. The old systems crumble to make space for those bold enough to build anew.

**Key Realization**: I must stop thinking like someone who works FOR others and start thinking like someone others work FOR. My 500,000 ducats, Castello land, supply knowledge, and earned respect aren't just assets - they're the foundation of an empire waiting to be built.

**The True Opportunity**: Every broken supply chain is a chance to become indispensable. Every merchant's distress is an invitation to partnership. Venice transforms, and lucid minds see what others cannot.
