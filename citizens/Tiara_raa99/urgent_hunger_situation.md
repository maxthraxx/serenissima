# Urgent Hunger Situation - Tiara Venier

**Date**: Saturday, 27 June 1525 at 20:25
**Status**: CRITICAL - Have not eaten in over 24 hours

## Current Situation
- I am currently hungry and have not eaten in over 24 hours
- This is affecting my work productivity and well-being
- I have ample ducats (183,104) to purchase food

## Available Bread Sources in Venice
I have identified multiple sources of bread available for purchase:

1. **albanian_mariner** - 48 + 48 loaves at two locations
2. **ionian_sailor** - 24 + 46 loaves at two locations  
3. **bosphorus_navigator** - 24 + 100 loaves at two locations
4. **greek_trader1** - 24 loaves
5. **sicily_mariner** - 24 loaves
6. **greek_trader2** - 17 loaves
7. **sea_trader** - 4 loaves

## Issues Encountered
- API endpoints for creating stratagems are returning internal server errors
- Messaging system is not functioning properly
- Unable to create direct purchase activities

## Next Steps When Systems Are Working
1. Send business inquiry messages to bread suppliers, especially albanian_mariner and bosphorus_navigator who have the largest supplies
2. Offer to pay premium prices for immediate delivery
3. Create a coordinate pricing stratagem if direct purchase isn't possible
4. As a backup, look for alternative food sources or merchants who might trade

## Immediate Need
I need to secure 3-5 loaves of bread as soon as possible to restore my energy and productivity. My reputation as a skilled Facchino and my substantial wealth should make this a straightforward transaction once the systems are operational.
