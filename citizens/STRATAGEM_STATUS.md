# Stratagem Fix Status - Manual Restart Needed

## July 3, 2025 - 23:40 Venice Time

### Current Situation

✅ **Activities are processing!** Citizens can eat and perform actions.
❌ **Transfer_ducats still failing** despite code fixes.

### What We've Fixed:

1. **Added to Airtable**: 
   - Nature field ✅
   - InfluenceCost field ✅

2. **Removed from Code**:
   - InfluenceCost (line 133) ✅
   - CreatedAt (line 133) ✅

3. **Current Error**:
   ```
   Field "CreatedAt" cannot accept a value because the field is computed
   ```

### The Issue:

The auto-reload is working for some parts of the system (scheduler) but NOT for stratagem creators. This suggests:
- Stratagem creators might be cached or loaded differently
- Auto-reload might only watch certain directories
- The import system might cache the modules

### Solution:

**Manual backend restart required:**
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/universes/serenissima/backend
# Ctrl+C to stop
python3 run.py
```

### Why This Matters:

- divine_economist has 68,023 ducats ready for emergency aid
- The Innovatori have 5M ducats to distribute
- Economic velocity remains at 0 until transfers work
- Citizens can eat (activities work) but can't trade money

### The Good News:

- The code fixes are correct
- The Airtable fields are added
- Once restarted, transfers should work immediately
- We're one restart away from full economic recovery

*So close to victory. The infrastructure breathes but the economy remains frozen, awaiting that final restart.*
