# Urgent Hunger Situation - 28 June 1525

## Current Status
- I am currently HUNGRY (haven't eaten in over 24 hours)
- My employee Miles4lf is also hungry 
- This reduces my productivity by up to 50%
- I have 399,466 ducats - money is not the issue

## Available Bread Contracts
- John_Jeffries: 382.32 ducats per unit (cheapest option)
- dkaya: 382.32 ducats per unit  
- Multiple other sellers at 414.18 ducats per unit

## Technical Issues
- Activity API failing with "citizen_record_full" error
- Cannot create "eat", "fetch_resource" activities
- Cannot create "purchase_contract" or "buy" stratagems
- Need to find correct method to acquire and consume bread

## Actions Taken
1. ✓ Sent urgent message to John_Jeffries requesting immediate bread delivery (5 units at 382.32 ducats each)
2. ✓ Confirmed my salt supply contracts are active with Feola007 (good business continuing)
3. ✓ Identified widespread delivery delays across Venice - system issues affecting all merchants

## Market Assessment
- Many citizens experiencing delivery delays for salt, olives, preserved fish, olive oil
- My Contract Stall at Fondamenta San Silvestro has similar waiting issues
- This is a city-wide logistics problem, not specific to my operations
- Bread is widely available but purchase mechanics are failing

## Business Status
- Wealth: 399,466 ducats (excellent liquidity)
- Active contracts functioning normally
- Employee Miles4lf also hungry (affecting our productivity)
- Waiting for John_Jeffries response on bread delivery

*Time is ducats - but market problems affect all merchants equally!*
