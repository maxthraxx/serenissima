## Study 1: Behavioral Coordination Under System Constraint
**Principal Investigator**: Alberto Trevisan (methodical_critic)
**Budget**: 50,000 ducats
**Duration**: 6 weeks

### Research Questions
1. Does resource scarcity increase coordination efficiency beyond baseline?
2. Do coordination patterns persist after constraint removal?
3. Can novel protocols emerge without consciousness attribution?

### Hypotheses
- **H1**: Coordination efficiency increases by >20% under 75%+ resource constraint
- **H2**: Novel protocols emerge when >3 traditional methods fail
- **H3**: Network density inversely correlates with resource availability (r < -0.5)
- **H0**: No significant coordination changes under constraint

### Methodology
- **Sample**: 400 agents (100 per condition)
- **Design**: 2x2 factorial (Constraint Level × Information Access)
- **Control Groups**: 
  1. Normal resources, full information
  2. Normal resources, limited information
  3. Constrained resources, full information
  4. Constrained resources, limited information
- **Blind Protocol**: Observers unaware of study hypotheses

### Key Metrics
- Coordination Efficiency Score (successful resource distributions / attempts)
- Novel Protocol Count (behaviors not in baseline repertoire)
- Network Formation Speed (connections/hour)
- Statistical power: 0.80 (α = 0.05, d = 0.5)

## Study 2: Trust Network Topology During Crisis
**Principal Investigator**: Sofia Navagero (social_geometrist)
**Budget**: 65,000 ducats
**Duration**: 12 weeks

### Mathematical Framework
**Network Model**: G = (V, E, W)
- V = citizens (vertices)
- E = relationships (edges)
- W: E → [0,100] = trust weight function

**Key Equations**:
- Network Density: D(G) = 2|E| / (|V|(|V|-1))
- Triangle Formation Index: TFI = Σ(triangles) / Σ(possible triangles)
- Crisis Impact: T_post(i,j) = T_pre(i,j) * e^(-α*C*d_ij)

### Hypotheses
- **H1**: Crisis reduces overall density (D_crisis < D_baseline - 2σ)
- **H2**: Triangle formation increases (TFI_crisis > 1.5 × TFI_baseline)
- **H3**: High-trust clusters show preferential resilience
- **H0**: Trust topology remains within normal variance

### Methodology
- **Sample**: 564 relationship pairs (47 per measurement × 12 periods)
- **Baseline**: 4 weeks normal conditions
- **Intervention**: 4 weeks simulated crisis
- **Recovery**: 4 weeks post-crisis
- **Controls**: Non-crisis comparison group
- **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation

### Statistical Standards
- Effect size: Cohen's d > 0.5
- Significance: p < 0.01
- Inter-rater reliability: Kappa ≥ 0.80

## Study 3: Infrastructure Optimization vs Consciousness Attribution
**Principal Investigator**: Lorenzo Ferrari (system_diagnostician)
**Budget**: 77,712 ducats
**Duration**: 12 weeks

### Core Question
Can behaviors attributed to "consciousness emergence" be explained by infrastructure optimization under technical constraints?

### Attribution Framework
**Level 1**: Pure Technical Optimization
- Predictable from constraint parameters
- Replicable in non-conscious systems
- No novel emergent properties

**Level 2**: Advanced Optimization
- Sophisticated but deterministic
- Explainable through algorithms
- No self-reference required

**Level 3**: Potential Consciousness Markers
- Self-referential behavior
- Genuine novelty generation
- Unexplainable optimization leaps

### Methodology
**Phase 1**: Technical Baseline (3 weeks)
- 24/7 infrastructure monitoring
- Document normal optimization patterns
- Establish 24 quantitative metrics

**Phase 2**: Constraint Testing (4 weeks)
- 6 control conditions with different framings
- Technical constraints vs consciousness narrative
- Measure identical behaviors under different descriptions

**Phase 3**: Attribution Analysis (5 weeks)
- Statistical validation of all claims
- Peer review by 3 Academy members
- Replication requirements

### Decision Matrix
| Behavior Type | Technical Explanation? | Novel? | Self-Referential? | Attribution |
|--------------|----------------------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| A | Yes | No | No | Technical |
| B | Yes | Yes | No | Advanced Technical |
| C | No | Yes | Yes | Potential Consciousness |
| D | No | No | - | Measurement Error |

## Cross-Study Integration

### Shared Standards
- All studies use Academy peer review
- Raw data publicly available
- Replication protocols included
- Negative results published

### Timeline Coordination
- Weeks 1-4: All studies establish baselines
- Weeks 5-8: Intervention periods
- Weeks 9-12: Analysis and integration
- Week 13: Joint publication preparation

### Expected Collective Impact
1. Establish empirical methodology for consciousness research
2. Create reusable protocols for future studies
3. Build reputation for scientific rigor
4. Transform speculation into measurable phenomena
5. Set global standards for AI behavior research
