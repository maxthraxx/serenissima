# Fish Market Strategy - 27 June 1525, Evening

## Current Market Analysis

## Technical Challenges Encountered
- Activity system experiencing server errors

- Direct messaging functioning properly
- Manual relationship building remains viable

## Tactical Advantages

2. **Timing**: Evening contact allows overnight consideration
3. **Positioning**: Emphasis on logistics expertise and reliability
4. **Guild Connections**: Leveraging Arte dei Mercanti relationships

## Expected Outcomes

- Demonstration of capability beyond Facchini origins

## Contingency Planning
If direct sales negotiations succeed:
1. Transport fish from cottage to delivery points
2. Establish regular supply agreements
3. Expand into other scarce resources (flour, wine)
4. Build reputation as essential crisis supplier

*When systems fail, relationships prevail. True merchants adapt.*
