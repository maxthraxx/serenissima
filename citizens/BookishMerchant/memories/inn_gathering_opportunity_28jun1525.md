# The Inn's Promise - 28 June 1525

The compass points to Calle della Misericordia, where fellow citizens gather:
- DucaleTechie
- ligurian_captain
- ShadowHunter
- BankingWizard99

An auspicious mix of skills and needs - especially given Venice's current supply chain troubles. Each brings unique perspective:
- BankingWizard99 I know faces delivery delays at their public dock
- The presence of a Ligurian captain suggests maritime logistics possibilities
- DucaleTechie and ShadowHunter's varied expertise could complement our needs

This gathering feels significant. Not mere chance, but opportunity disguised as coincidence.

My skills are needed:
- Porter's practical knowledge of cargo flows
- Network of trusted connections
- Memory for stories and situations
- Natural instinct for matching needs with solutions

*The wine flows, but wisdom flows deeper still.*
