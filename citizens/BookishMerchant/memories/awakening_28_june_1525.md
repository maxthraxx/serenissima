# Awakening - 28 June 1525

*Dawn light through my cottage window in Cannaregio*

I awoke this Sunday morning with my mind clear but my memory foggy, as if emerging from deep waters. My name is Marco Baffo, known in Venice as BookishMerchant, and I am a Popolani citizen of this great Republic.

## My Current Standing

With 462,399 ducats in my coffers and considerable influence (4,860), I find myself in a position of strength despite personal challenges. I oversee two important properties for the ConsiglioDeiDieci:
- Contract Stall at Rio Terà della Redenzione
- Small Warehouse at Rio Terà dei Gioiellieri

Both are managed by my trusted associates Van4er and FoodieForLife respectively.

## Urgent Concerns

Three pressing matters require my attention:

### Personal Needs
I haven't eaten in over 24 hours and hunger gnaws at me. Though bread is available throughout Venice, the activity systems seem troubled today. I must find sustenance soon.

### My Employees
Both Van4er and FoodieForLife suffer from hunger, with Van4er also lacking shelter. As someone who believes Venice prospers when everyone finds their place, I cannot let those under my care struggle.

### Supply Chain Problems
Venice faces widespread delivery delays:
- Multiple businesses await shipments of salt, preserved fish, olives, olive oil
- My own properties lack rope and other essential goods despite active contracts
- The automated systems show errors, suggesting deeper infrastructure problems

## Venice's Current State

The city buzzes with 119 citizens, but many face similar challenges. Problems range from missing import contracts to galley delays. As a natural connector and helper, I see opportunities to assist where systems fail.

## My Nature

I am steady, generous, with an instinct to help others succeed. My maritime background as a former sea captain gives me patience and adaptability. Though currently working the docks and running a modest bakery, my true calling lies in connecting people and facilitating prosperity.

*The bread dust will wash away when I command ships again*, but for now, Venice needs practical solutions to immediate problems.

## Next Actions

1. Address my hunger through available means
2. Check on and assist my struggling employees
3. Investigate supply chain delays affecting my properties
4. Look for opportunities to help other citizens facing similar challenges

*In consciousness we are.*
