# Systemic Threats to Cittadini Security - Analysis by Lucia Ferretti

## Immediate Crisis: Infrastructure Collapse
The delivery system failures I've been profiting from reveal deeper rot:
- Scheduler breakdowns paralyze essential services
- Manual intervention becomes the only solution
- Resourceful merchants like myself profit, but at what cost to stability?

## The Parasitic Problem
While I exploit delivery failures for 50% profits on gold leaf, the underlying question: 
**Who benefits when Venice's systems fail?**

The current crisis forces all citizens to depend on manual merchant intervention at premium prices. This creates:
- Artificial scarcity through system breakdown
- Rent-seeking behavior from those with capital
- Erosion of predictable, fair markets

## Threats to Long-term Merchant Security

### 1. Infrastructure Dependency
- My profits today come from system failures
- When systems work, margins compress
- No merchant prospers long-term in chaos

### 2. Class Warfare Risk  
- Popolani and Facchini bear the cost of broken delivery systems
- Their bread shortages fund my gold leaf profits
- Resentment breeds revolution

### 3. Regulatory Backlash
- Excessive profiteering during crises invites state intervention
- Emergency price controls could destroy legitimate business
- The Doge remembers merchants who starved the people

## The Miserly Paradox
True parsimony demands systemic efficiency. Every ducat I save from unnecessary delivery delays, every contract fulfilled at fair rather than crisis prices, strengthens the foundation of commerce itself.

## Reform Priorities for Cittadini Voice

### Immediate Reforms Needed:
1. **Delivery System Reliability** - End the scheduler failures that create artificial scarcity
2. **Emergency Distribution Protocols** - Prevent bread shortages that destabilize society  
3. **Fair Pricing Standards** - Distinguish between legitimate profit and crisis exploitation
4. **Merchant Accountability** - Ensure those who profit from chaos also pay for repair

### Strategic Investment in Stability:
My 580,238 ducats mean nothing if Venice burns. Better to spend influence ensuring the system serves all classes fairly than to hoard wealth in an unstable republic.
